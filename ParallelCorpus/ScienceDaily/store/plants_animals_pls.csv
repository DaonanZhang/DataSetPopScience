Researchers have been studying the transcription factor SREBP, a critical regulator of lipid biosynthesis. Precursor SREBP proteins, located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the cell, are transported through the golgi apparatus to the nucleus. Here, they promote the transcription of genes associated with lipid biosynthesis, playing a pivotal role in regulating cholesterol. SREBP-1c, a specific member of the SREBP family, is known to activate fatty acid synthesis. Interestingly, this process is inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids. The exact mechanism behind this regulation, however, remains to be elucidated.

The research team elucidated a novel cleavage mechanism of SREBP-1c, a protein involved in fatty acid synthesis, and confirmed its regulation by fatty acids. The cleavage of SREBP-1c occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, with the rhomboid protease RHBDL4, located in the ER membrane, identified as a new cleavage enzyme for SREBP-1c. This cleavage process is activated by saturated fatty acids and deactivated by polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggesting that RHBDL4's activity is modulated by the type of fatty acid. Additionally, the team discovered a unique mechanism where the VCP complex extracts the cleaved SREBP-1c protein from the endoplasmic reticulum. In the livers of mice deficient in the RHBDL4 gene and fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet, the activation of SREBP-1c cleavage was suppressed. This inhibited the expression of a group of target genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis and uptake, and lipoprotein secretion, which improved fatty liver pathophysiology, as observed in wild-type mice.
The RHBDL4-SREBP-1c pathway, uncovered in this study, represents a lipid homeostasis mechanism regulated by fatty acids. This groundbreaking discovery is anticipated to pave the way for developing new therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders and lifestyle-related diseases stemming from abnormal lipid metabolism.

However, mechanisms by which the cell responds to the levels of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids remain underexplored. Here, we show that RHBDL4/RHBDD1, a rhomboid family protease, directly cleaves SREBP-1c at the ER. The p97/VCP, AAA-ATPase complex then acts as an auxiliary segregase to extract the remaining ER-embedded fragment of SREBP-1c. Importantly, the enzymatic activity of RHBDL4 is enhanced by saturated fatty acids (SFAs) but inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Genetic deletion of RHBDL4 in mice fed on a Western diet enriched in SFAs and cholesterol prevented SREBP-1c from inducing genes for lipogenesis, particularly for synthesis and incorporation of PUFAs, and secretion of lipoproteins. The RHBDL4-SREBP-1c pathway reveals a regulatory system for monitoring fatty acid composition and maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis."

The number of infections by the tick-borne TBE virus that are not detected by health services is far higher than previously assumed. This has been shown in a new study of Swedish blood donors from Uppsala University and the University Hospital in Uppsala. The results have been published in the journal Eurosurveillance, which is associated with the EU's Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

""We were very surprised that such a high proportion of the blood donors showed traces of a previous TBE virus infection. This is far more than could have been suspected based on the number of reported cases,"" says Bo Albinsson, doctoral student at Uppsala University, one of the first authors of the article.
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a very serious disease that is increasingly common in large parts of Europe. According to statistics from the Public Health Agency of Sweden, 597 cases of the disease had been reported in Sweden by November 2023, the highest number ever registered in a single year.
TBE has been a notifiable disease since 2004 under the Communicable Diseases Act and all cases must therefore be reported to the regional infection control doctor and the Public Health Agency of Sweden. However, people who only develop mild symptoms or no symptoms at all are not detected by the health services and therefore do not show up in the statistics. Until now, the relationship between the number of reported cases and the proportion of people infected was unknown.
Traditional methods of investigating whether someone has previously been infected by the virus are not completely reliable as individuals who have been vaccinated against TBE can also test positive. On top of this, it is not known exactly how many people have been vaccinated, since Sweden has no national vaccination register for TBE.
In the new study, the result of a Swedish collaboration, the researchers have investigated blood tests from 2,700 anonymous blood donors from nine regions in Sweden. The method they used is called TBE-SMIA (suspension multiplex immunoassay) and was developed at the Zoonosis Science Center (ZSC) at Uppsala University in collaboration with the Clinical Microbiology Department at Uppsala University Hospital. It makes it possible for the first time to effectively distinguish the antibody response after TBE virus infection from the response after TBE vaccination. This has enabled the researchers to identify how many people have had the infection. They were also able to estimate the proportion of the population in each region that is vaccinated.
The results showed that the proportion of blood donors with a history of TBE virus infection varied from 1 per cent to 7 per cent between the different regions. Based on the population sizes of the regions, the researchers estimated that this corresponds to a total of more than 160,000 people aged 15-65, which is significantly higher than previous estimates.
The researchers also found that the proportion of blood donors vaccinated against TBE varied between 8.7 per cent and 57 per cent in the different regions. In total, this translates to over 1.6 million Swedes (aged 15-65) in the regions investigated.
""It is noteworthy that the number of confirmed TBE cases is increasing despite relatively good vaccination coverage. Further research is therefore needed, for example by carefully mapping the distribution of the virus in different tick populations. Our results provide an important background for future vaccination strategies and we believe it would be well worth considering establishing a national vaccination register for TBE,"" says Tove Hoffman, researcher at the ZSC and the study's other first author.

This is largely due to the absence of a national tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccination registry, scarcity of previous serological studies and use of serological methods not distinguishing between antibodies induced by vaccination and infection. Furthermore, the number of notified TBE cases in Sweden has continued to increase in recent years despite increased vaccination. The aim was to estimate the TBEV seroprevalence in Sweden. In 2018 and 2019, 2,700 serum samples from blood donors in nine Swedish regions were analysed using a serological method that can distinguish antibodies induced by vaccination from antibodies elicited by infection. The regions were chosen to reflect differences in notified TBE incidence. The overall seroprevalence varied from 9.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.6–13.6%) to 64.0% (95% CI: 58.3–69.4%) between regions. The proportion of vaccinated individuals ranged from 8.7% (95% CI: 5.8–12.6) to 57.0% (95% CI: 51.2–62.6) and of infected from 1.0% (95% CI: 0.2–3.0) to 7.0% (95% CI: 4.5–10.7). Thus, more than 160,000 and 1,600,000 individuals could have been infected by TBEV and vaccinated against TBE, respectively. The mean manifestation index was 3.1%. A difference was observed between low- and high-incidence TBE regions, on the overall TBEV seroprevalence and when separated into vaccinated and infected individuals. The estimated incidence and manifestation index argue that a large proportion of TBEV infections are not diagnosed."

Salmonella is notorious for surviving and replicating in macrophages, which are normally lethal to invading bacteria because of their inhospitable environment. In a new study, researchers have discovered how a system of proteins, called TamAB, helps Salmonella survive under the harsh conditions inside macrophages.

Salmonella is a foodborne pathogen that causes more than a million infections each year in the U.S. Concerningly, it can kill young, old, and immunocompromised individuals. What makes these bacteria especially dangerous is their ability to evade our immune responses.
Macrophages are designed to kill bacteria by spraying them with antibacterial products, exposing them to acidic environments, and withholding magnesium, all of which target the outer layers of the bacteria. Salmonella, however, has evolved mechanisms to survive and grow in this environment.
Under normal conditions, Salmonella uses a complex called Bam to assemble certain proteins that are transported to its outer membrane layer. In previous studies, the group have shown that inside macrophages, the complex is compromised and, as a result, Salmonella depends on the PhoPQ system to sense the environment and orchestrate necessary changes in the outer membrane.
Studies in other bacteria have shown that the TamAB complex performs similar functions to Bam, which led the researchers of the present study to ask whether it might be important in Salmonella. They found that the genes that were responsible for producing TamAB were being controlled by PhoPQ.
""We knew from other studies that TamA was similar to BamA in its structure. When we realized that PhoPQ was controlling this TamAB complex, we hypothesized that the Bam complex struggles in the macrophage and TamA is induced by PhoPQ to help,"" said James Slauch (IGOH), a professor of microbiology.
To test their hypothesis, the researchers first removed TamAB from Salmonella. To their surprise, these mutants were still able to cause an infection in mice. However, when they also crippled the Bam complex, the mutants that lacked TamAB struggled.

The researchers also saw similar results when they recreated the macrophage-like conditions in test tubes and tested the different Salmonella mutants. They observed that mutants that lacked both the Bam and TamAB complexes were sensitive to vancomycin. This result is particularly intriguing because vancomycin is not used to treat Salmonella since it can't cross the outer membrane. This sensitivity suggests that the two complexes have a function in creating or maintaining the outer membrane, although the mechanism is not clear.
""Basically, TamAB helps create favorable conditions for the Bam complex to work but it's indirect,"" said Yekaterina Golubeva, a research scientist in the Slauch lab.
It is still unclear what the indirect effect might be. ""The problem is that studying the outer membrane is complicated because everything is interconnected. If you mess up the Bam complex, it disrupts additional machineries required for synthesis of the outer membrane. As a result, understanding the contributions of these proteins is difficult,"" Slauch said.
Nonetheless, the researchers are now interested in figuring out how TamAB helps. To do so, they will be using suppressor mutants that have accumulated different types of mutations that can help them grow even if their Bam and Tam complexes are defective, providing insights into Salmonella's outer membrane structure and function.
""There are efforts underway in biotechnology companies that are targeting the Bam complex as a way to treat Salmonella infections,"" Slauch said. ""Understanding the structure of the outer membrane when Salmonella is in a macrophage can help us understand what will affect its sensitivity to drugs and our results with vancomycin is consistent with that.""
The study ""TamAB is regulated by PhoPQ and functions in outer membrane homeostasis during Salmonella pathogenesis"" was published in the Journal of Bacteriology. The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

The PhoPQ two-component system responds to the phagosome environment and induces factors that protect the outer membrane, allowing adaptation and growth in the macrophage. We show that PhoPQ induces the transcription of the tamAB operon both in vitro and in macrophages. The TamA protein is structurally similar to BamA, an essential protein in the Bam complex that assembles β-barrel proteins in the outer membrane, while TamB is an AsmA-family protein implicated in lipid transport between the inner and outer membranes. We show that the Bam machinery is stressed in vitro under low Mg 2+ , low pH conditions that mimic the phagosome. Not surprisingly, mutations affecting Bam function confer significant virulence defects. Although loss of TamAB alone confers no virulence defect, a tamAB deletion confers a synthetic phenotype in bam mutant backgrounds in animals and macrophages, and in vitro upon treatment with vancomycin or sodium dodecyl sulfate. Mutations affecting YhdP, which functions in partial redundancy with TamB, also confer synthetic phenotypes with bam mutations in the animal, but this interaction is not evident in vitro . Thus, in the harsh phagocytic environment of the macrophage, the outer membrane Bam machinery is compromised, and the TamAB system, and perhaps other PhoPQ-regulated factors, is induced to compensate. It is most likely that TamAB and other systems assist the Bam complex indirectly by affecting outer membrane properties. The TamAB system has been implicated in both outer membrane protein localization and phospholipid transport between the inner and outer membranes. We show that the β-barrel protein assembly complex, Bam, is stressed under conditions thought to mimic the macrophage phagosome. TamAB expression is controlled by the PhoPQ two-component system and induced in macrophages. This system somehow compensates for the Bam complex as evidenced by the fact that mutations affecting the two systems confer synthetic phenotypes in animals, macrophages, and in vitro in the presence of vancomycin or SDS. This study has implications concerning the role of TamAB in outer membrane homeostasis. It also contributes to our understanding of the systems necessary for Salmonella to adapt and reproduce within the macrophage phagosome."

An international team of scientists led by researchers from the Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM-CSIC) in Barcelona has uncovered the ocean's intricate web of microbial interactions across depths. Research details are reported in a study published recently in the journal Nature Communications that provides crucial insights into the functioning of ocean ecosystems.

""This research marks a significant advance in our understanding of how microbial interactions in the ocean's vast ecosystems operate across different depths and regions,"" states the ICM-CSIC researcher Ramiro Logares, who highlights the key role of marine microscopic microorganisms in the cycling of various nutrients and carbon fixation, as well as in the functioning of marine food webs in general.
Until now, only the microbial associations in the surface waters of the ocean, at a global scale, had been explored. This study goes further by exploring how microbial interactions may change from the surface to deep sea waters across several locations of the tropical and subtropical global ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
Concretely, the study uses cutting-edge association networks to explore the ecological interactions among archaea, bacteria, and picoeukaryotes in the marine microbiome. It reveals that potential microbial interactions in the ocean vary significantly with both depth and geographical location.
Ocean depth, a key factor 
One important finding is that while some interactions are global, occurring consistently across various regions at the same depth, a significant proportion (11-36%) are regional and specific to certain depths. For example, the deepest zones show the least global associations.
""The bathypelagic zone, the deepest part of the ocean, exhibits the lowest proportion of global associations, with regional associations increasing with depth,"" adds in this regard Dra Ina M. Deutschmann, expert in biomathematics.

Conversely, surface associations do not persist deeper into the ocean, despite the vertical dispersal of microbes, which transfers surface cells into deep sea waters.
To carry out the study, the scientific team used innovative association network approaches that allowed them to predict ecological interactions among microbes in individual samples. This permitted them to quantify the dynamics of networks across the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the ocean.
All in all, the research is pivotal in enhancing our understanding of the ocean's microbial interactions or interactome. By mapping the intricate web of microbial interactions, the study provides crucial insights into the functioning of ocean ecosystems, which are essential for the planet's health.
The findings could have significant implications for society, as they can help predict the effects of climate change on oceanic ecosystems by assessing how association networks respond to environmental changes.

The so-called Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (for short: RYMV) is responsible for high crop losses in Africa, particularly among small-scale farmers. A research team from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (HHU) and the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) has now produced rice lines that are resistant to the disease by means of genome editing. The rice varieties, the development of which the team describes in Plant Biotechnology Journal, are a preliminary step toward being able to generate resistant locally adapted elite varieties for small-scale food producers in Africa.

RYMV is an RNA virus spread by beetles and direct leaf-to-leaf contact. In Africa, where the majority of producers farm plots of land barely one hectare in size, between ten and one hundred percent of the rice harvests are regularly lost to this virus. This makes it a life-threatening problem for the poorest farmers.
There is no effective protection against the virus. ""The only real protection is to develop rice varieties that possess a resistance gene against RYMV, which would make the plant invulnerable,"" says Dr Yugander Arra, lead author of the study now published in Plant Biotechnology Journal. A research team from the Institute for Molecular Physiology at HHU (headed by Professor Dr Wolf B. Frommer) and the Institut de recherche pour le développement (IRD) in Montpellier, France, has developed such resistant rice lines.
Three resistance genes are currently known; mutations in just one of the genes, called RYMV1, 2 and 3, are sufficient to achieve resistance. The resistant form rymv2 occurs in poor-yielding African rice (Oryza glaberrima) varieties. RYMV2, also known as CPR5.1, encodes an important protein from the pores of the cell nucleus. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the loss of the only gene copy of CPR5 results in a broad spectrum of resistance not only to viruses, but also to bacteria and fungi. However, growth is severely restricted, the plants exhibit spontaneous lesions and produce low yields. So it was important to test whether rymv2 resistance could be transferred to other rice varieties without negative consequences.
In Africa, other high-yield rice varieties based on the Asian species Oryza indica are mainly used and these do not have the resistance gene. Inserting the relevant gene is however not a particularly promising approach as the descendants of such ""inter-species"" hybrids are highly sterile and therefore cannot reproduce and pass on the resistance easily.
Using the CRISPR/Cas genome editing method, the research group has now shown that mutations of the RYMV2 gene can be produced in an Asian rice variety that make it resistant to the virus in a similar way to the African form. In the next step, the aim is to edit relevant African elite varieties in the same way in order to then make them available to African small-scale producers. Helping these farmers is the goal of the international research consortium ""Healthy Crops,"" which is headed by HHU.
Background: Plants have hereditary mechanisms that were useful for survival in the early days of evolution, but which are now more likely to be harmful. Maize is a good example of this: A gene causes the kernels to be aborted when drought conditions prevail at the time of fertilisation. This trait caused by the gene was good for the wild perennial forebears of today's maize plants, but has a detrimental effect on the yield of the annual plants now used in agriculture.

The situation is similar with the rice examined here. Professor Frommer: ""This resistance trait is attributable to the loss of a gene function that is not essential. If we switch the gene off completely, the plants behave normally. However, as a result of the loss of the gene function, they are resistant to the virus.""
Dr Eliza Loo, Healthy Crops Group Leader, adds: ""It is so to speak an archetype, which was useful for its forebears, but which now leads to devastating crop losses in periods of drought. It would appear expedient to switch this gene off and it has no obvious side effects.""
Surprisingly, neither switching off the closely related CPR5.2 gene nor the two genes RYMV2 and CPR5.2 -- at least under greenhouse conditions -- leads to impairments. It is also noteworthy that the loss of CPR5.2 does not lead to RYMV resistance. Everything indicates that editing the RYMV2 gene is a promising approach to combating the rice disease in Africa.
The research took place within the framework of the Cluster of Excellence for Plant Research CEPLAS and was funded as part of Prof Frommer's Alexander von Humboldt Professorship.

Management of RYMV is challenging. Genetic resistance provides the most effective and environment‐friendly control. The recessive resistance locus rymv2 (OsCPR5.1) had been identified in African rice (Oryza glaberrima), however, introgression into Oryza sativa ssp. japonica and indica remains challenging due to crossing barriers. Here, we evaluated whether CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of the two rice nucleoporin paralogs OsCPR5.1 (RYMV2) and OsCPR5.2 can be used to introduce RYMV resistance into the japonica variety Kitaake. Both paralogs had been shown to complement the defects of the Arabidopsis atcpr5 mutant, indicating partial redundancy. Despite striking sequence and structural similarities between the two paralogs, only oscpr5.1 loss‐of‐function mutants were fully resistant, while loss‐of‐function oscpr5.2 mutants remained susceptible, intimating that OsCPR5.1 plays a specific role in RYMV susceptibility. Notably, edited lines with short in‐frame deletions or replacements in the N‐terminal domain (predicted to be unstructured) of OsCPR5.1 were hypersusceptible to RYMV. In contrast to mutations in the single Arabidopsis AtCPR5 gene, which caused severely dwarfed plants, oscpr5.1 and oscpr5.2 single and double knockout mutants showed neither substantial growth defects nor symptoms indicative lesion mimic phenotypes, possibly reflecting functional differentiation. The specific editing of OsCPR5.1, while maintaining OsCPR5.2 activity, provides a promising strategy for generating RYMV‐resistance in elite Oryza sativa lines as well as for effective stacking with other RYMV resistance genes or other traits."

The sun has just set on a quiet mudflat in Australia's Northern Territory; it'll set again in another 19 hours. A young moon looms large over the desolate landscape. No animals scurry in the waning light. No leaves rustle in the breeze. No lichens encrust the exposed rock. The only hint of life is some scum in a few puddles and ponds. And among it lives a diverse microbial community of our ancient ancestors.

In a new account of exquisitely preserved microfossils, researchers at UC Santa Barbara and McGill University revealed that eukaryotic organisms had already evolved into a diverse array of forms even 1.64 billion years ago. The paper, published in the journal Papers in Paleontology, recounts an assemblage of eukaryotic fossils from an era early in the group's evolutionary history. The authors describe four new taxa, as well as evidence of several advanced characteristics already present in these early eukaryotes.
""These are among the oldest eukaryotes that have ever been discovered,"" explained lead author Leigh Anne Riedman, an assistant researcher in UCSB's Department of Earth Science. ""Yet, even in these first records we're seeing a lot of diversity.""
Eukarya forms one of the major domains of life, encompassing the plant, animal and fungi clades, as well as all other groups whose cells have a membrane-bound nucleus, like protists and seaweeds. Many scientists had thought early eukaryotes were all fairly similar during the late Paleoproterozoic, and that diversification took place around 800 million years ago. But Riedman and her co-authors found fossils of a delightfully diverse, and complex, cast of characters in rock nearly twice as old.
Scientists knew from previous studies that eukaryotes had evolved by this time, but their diversity in this era was poorly understood. So Riedman headed to the Outback in late 2019. Within one week, she had collected about 430 samples from eight cores drilled by a prospecting company; they now reside in the library of the Northern Territory Geological Survey. The two cores used for this study spanned roughly 500 meters of stratigraphy, or 133 million years, with around 15 million years of significant deposition.
Riedman returned to the United States with shale and mudstone: remnants of an ancient coastal ecosystem that alternated between shallow, subtidal mudflats and coastal lagoons. A dip in hydrofluoric acid dissolved the matrix rock, concentrating the precious microfossils which she then analyzed under the microscope.
""We were hoping to find species with interesting and different characteristics to their cell walls,"" Riedman said. She hoped that these features could shed light on what was happening within the cells during this time period. Reaching any conclusions about the cellular interior would require a great deal of sleuthing, though, since the fossils preserve only the exterior of the cells.

The researchers were surprised by the diversity and complexity preserved in these fossils. They recorded 26 taxa, including 10 previously undescribed species. The team found indirect evidence of cytoskeletons, as well as platy structures that suggest the presence of internal vesicles in which the plates were formed -- perhaps ancestral to Golgi bodies, present in modern eukaryotic cells. Other microbes had cell walls made of bound fibers, similarly suggestive of the presence of a complex cytoskeleton.
The authors also found cells with a tiny trapdoor, evidence of a degree of sophistication. Some microbes can form a cyst to wait out unfavorable environmental conditions. In order to emerge, they need to be able to etch an opening in their protective shell. Making this door is a specialized process. ""If you're going to produce an enzyme that dissolves your cell wall, you need to be really careful about how you use that enzyme,"" Riedman said. ""So in one of the earliest records of eukaryotes, we're seeing some pretty impressive levels of complexity.""
Many people in the field had thought this ability emerged later, and the evidence for it in this assemblage further emphasizes how diverse and advanced eukaryotes were even at this early juncture. ""The assumption has always been that this is around the time that eukaryotes appeared. And now we think that people just haven't explored older rocks,"" said co-author Susannah Porter, an Earth science professor at UC Santa Barbara.
This paper is part of a larger project investigating early eukaryote evolution. Riedman and Porter want to know in what environments early eukaryotes were diversifying, why they were there, when they migrated to other places, and what adaptations they needed in order to fill those new niches.
A big part of this effort involves understanding when different characteristics of eukaryotes first arose. For instance, the authors are quite interested to learn whether these organisms were adapted to oxygenated or anoxic environments. The former would suggest that they had an aerobic metabolism, and possibly mitochondria. Every modern eukaryote that's been found descends from ancestors that possessed mitochondria. This suggests that eukaryotes acquired the organelle very early on, and that it provided a significant advantage.
Riedman and Porter are currently working on a fresh account of eukaryote diversity through time. They've also collected even older samples from Western Australia and Minnesota. Meanwhile, their geochemist collaborators at McGill are spearheading a study on oxygen levels and preferred eukaryote habitats, aspects that could shed light on their evolution.
""These results are a directive to go look for older material, older eukaryotes, because this is clearly not the beginning of eukaryotes on Earth,"" Riedman said.

This estimate indicates that the oldest eukaryote‐bearing units already show species richness levels similar to those of the much younger and more heavily sampled Tonian period. Additionally, these oldest eukaryotic assemblages show significant morphological disparity, particularly in vesicle construction. These high levels of eukaryotic species richness and morphological disparity suggest that although late Palaeoproterozoic units preserve our oldest record of eukaryotes, the eukaryotic clade has a much deeper history."

Curtin University research using thermal imaging of numbats in Western Australia has found that during hot weather the endangered animals are limited to as little as ten minutes of activity in the sun before they overheat to a body temperature of greater than 40°C.

Lead author Dr Christine Cooper, from Curtin's School of Molecular and Life Sciences, said despite using techniques such as raising or flattening their fur to regulate body temperature, numbats were prone to overheating, which was an important consideration for future conservation efforts, particularly given our warming climate.
""Active only during the day and with an exclusive diet of termites, numbats are often exposed to high temperatures and gain heat from direct sunlight. Even when in the shade they gain heat from radiation from the ground, rocks and trees,"" Dr Cooper said.
""We found when it is cold, numbats keep warm by raising their fur to provide better insulation and to allow more radiation to penetrate. When it is hot, they depress their fur to facilitate heat loss and shield the skin from solar radiation. In this way their body functions as a thermal window that allows heat exchange.
""The numbats' distinctive stripes do not have a role in heat balance, rather their most likely function is for camouflage.""
Dr Cooper said numbats used to be found across southern Australia but were now restricted to two remaining natural populations at Dryandra Woodland, near Narrogin, where the study was done, and Perup Nature Reserve, near Manjimup, with some additional re-introduced populations.
""With an estimated population of only about 2000, numbats are under threat from habitat loss and introduced predators like foxes and feral cats,"" Dr Cooper said.
""In terms of habitat requirements, our findings show the importance of considering temperature and shade availability when planning translocations for the conservation of this endangered species, particularly given our warming climate.
""Even with shade available, higher temperatures will reduce how long numbats can forage during the day, and because they have limited capacity to become more nocturnal, heat may become problematic for numbats.

Body surface temperature was measured using infra-red thermography at environmental wet and dry bulb temperatures of 11.7–29°C and 16.4–49.3°C, respectively; surface temperature varied for different body parts and with environmental temperature. Radiative and convective heat exchange varied markedly with environmental conditions and for various body surfaces reflecting their shapes, surface areas and projected areas. Both the anterior and posterior dorsolateral body areas functioned as thermal windows. Numbats in the shade had lower rates of solar radiative heat gain but non-solar avenues for radiative heat gain were substantial. Radiative gain was higher for black and lower for white stripes, but overall, the stripes had no thermal role. Total heat gain was generally positive (&lt;4 to &gt;20 W) and often greatly exceeded metabolic heat production (3–6 W). Our heat balance model indicates that high environmental heat loads limit foraging in open areas to as little as 10 min and that climate change may extend periods of inactivity, with implications for future conservation and management. We conclude that non-invasive thermal imaging is informative for modelling heat balance of free-living mammals."

Sharks have persisted as powerful ocean predators for more than 400 million years. They survived five mass extinctions, diversifying into an amazing variety of forms and lifestyles. But this ancient lineage is now among the world's most threatened species groups due to overexploitation in poorly regulated fisheries and the proliferation of wasteful finning practices.

Governments around the world have introduced a host of regulations aimed at reducing shark catch and finning, the latter of which typically sees valuable shark fins retained for sale while carcasses are discarded at sea. But until now, there was no assessment of how effective these measures have been. A new, global assessment revealed that, while some regulations do work, overall, sharks are caught by coastal fisheries at increasing rates.
The results, published in the journal Science, are the product of an international team of researchers working to understand trends in shark mortality across 150 fishing countries and in the high seas. They examined shark catches from 2012 to 2019 -- a time when many new regulations were implemented -- to see whether conservation measures reduced species losses. They also conducted in-depth interviews with shark fishery experts to better contextualize current trends in shark finning and fishing practices. In all, the dataset tracked the fates of an estimated 1.1 billion sharks caught by fisheries around the world.
Led by researchers at Dalhousie University, UC Santa Barbara and The Nature Conservancy, the team came to a surprising conclusion. They found total shark fishing mortality increased from 76 million to 80 million sharks per year even though protective legislation to reduce finning increased more than 10-fold during the same time. More than 30% of this catch was for species currently threatened with extinction. When also accounting for sharks not properly identified by species, the global mortality estimate rose to 101 million sharks in 2019.
""The unsustainable fishing of sharks is a global problem of staggering proportions that could eventually lead to the extinction of some of our planet's most ancient and revered species,"" said senior author Darcy Bradley, an adjunct faculty member at UC Santa Barbara and a scientist with the Nature Conservancy in California. ""We found that despite myriad regulations intended to curb shark overfishing, the total number of sharks being killed by fisheries each year is not decreasing. If anything, it's slightly increasing.""
The increase came primarily from coastal shark fisheries. These activities account for 95% of total shark fishing mortality globally in terms of the number of individual sharks caught and killed. Shark mortality in these fisheries increased steadily by 4% between 2012 and 2019. This contrasted with regulated open-ocean fisheries, especially across the Atlantic and western Pacific, where shark mortality decreased by an estimated 7%.
""We show that widespread legislation designed to prevent shark finning was successful in addressing this wasteful practise but did not reduce mortality overall,"" said lead author Boris Worm, a research professor in the Department of Biology at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. ""Too many sharks are still dying; this is especially worrisome for threatened species such as hammerheads.""
The team also analyzed the relationship between shark catches and shark fishing regulations by country, finding that shark fishing prohibitions and accountable governance were the only measures associated with reduced mortality.

""Complete bans on shark fishing, through protective measures such as shark sanctuaries can be successful, highlighting an opportunity to prioritize these and other area-based conservation measures,"" explained Bradley.
Nearly 70% of maritime jurisdictions around the world have introduced some regulatory measures to eliminate shark finning and associated fishing mortality, little of which existed 20 years ago. ""The amazing thing is that it's not just one or two countries, but that all around the world, governments and some fishing companies have committed to eliminating finning, often in response to public pressure. The challenge now is to build on this momentum and get stronger measures in place to reduce shark catches overall,"" said co-author Laurenne Schiller, a post-doctoral fellow at Carleton University, Ottawa.
While the researchers found that finning prohibitions likely reduced shark finning at sea, these regulations had little effect on mortality overall. In fact, they may have even increased catches, possibly by incentivising the full use of sharks and creating additional markets for shark meat and other products.
Co-author Leonardo Feitosa, a shark biologist from Brazil now working at UC Santa Barbara, explained: ""We have seen the demand for shark fins decreasing and the demand for shark meat increasing, with Brazil and Italy being the main consumers. Because shark meat is a relatively cheap substitute for other types of fish, there is considerable mislabeling, making some consumers eat shark meat without their knowledge.""
The authors conclude that shark fishing continues to present a substantial threat to shark populations, but that proven solutions are working where they are applied. ""It's clear from our analysis that cracking down on shark finning is not enough,"" said Echelle Burns, a data scientist at UC Santa Barbara. ""More specific measures that address shark mortality -- like prohibiting fishing in certain areas or requiring fishers to release vulnerable species that they accidentally caught -- can help protect more sharks.""
""Effective conservation actions for sharks are often impeded by lack of community-based awareness and stewardship projects,"" added co-author Nidhi D'Costa, a shark researcher from Bangladesh now working at Dalhousie. ""This is especially crucial in countries where small-scale artisanal fisheries are a major driver of shark mortality.""
The authors recommend combining geographic protections with fishing regulations to improve the outlook for sharks. New policies need to specifically discourage the retention of overfished and threatened species and help reduce shark bycatch. They also stress the importance of accountability of fleets, fishing companies and management bodies to support the successful implementation of these measures.

""Our analysis highlights the need for improved transparency and reporting requirements,"" explained Sara Orofino, a data analyst at UC Santa Barbara. ""Shark catches are often self-reported, aggregated into broad groups, and crucial information on discarding practices is often lacking. Accurate, comprehensive, and accessible data are critical to effectively evaluate how well regulations are working in safeguarding sharks and other threatened species.""
Maria Deng Palomares, senior scientist and project manager at the Sea Around Us initiative, University of British Columbia concludes: ""There is a path forward to avoid a global extinction crisis for sharks, but the time to act is now.""

Mortality increased by 4% in coastal waters but decreased by 7% in pelagic fisheries, especially across the Atlantic and Western Pacific. By linking fishing mortality data to the global regulatory landscape, we show that widespread legislation designed to prevent shark finning did not reduce mortality but that regional shark fishing or retention bans had some success.

With human retinas grown in a petri dish, researchers discovered how an offshoot of vitamin A generates the specialized cells that enable people to see millions of colors, an ability that dogs, cats, and other mammals do not possess.

""These retinal organoids allowed us for the first time to study this very human-specific trait,"" said author Robert Johnston, an associate professor of biology. ""It's a huge question about what makes us human, what makes us different.""
The findings, published in PLOS Biology, increase understanding of color blindness, age-related vision loss, and other diseases linked to photoreceptor cells. They also demonstrate how genes instruct the human retina to make specific color-sensing cells, a process scientists thought was controlled by thyroid hormones.
By tweaking the cellular properties of the organoids, the research team found that a molecule called retinoic acid determines whether a cone will specialize in sensing red or green light. Only humans with normal vision and closely related primates develop the red sensor.
Scientists for decades thought red cones formed through a coin toss mechanism where the cells haphazardly commit to sensing green or red wavelengths -- and research from Johnston's team recently hinted that the process could be controlled by thyroid hormone levels. Instead, the new research suggests red cones materialize through a specific sequence of events orchestrated by retinoic acid within the eye.
The team found that high levels of retinoic acid in early development of the organoids correlated with higher ratios of green cones. Similarly, low levels of the acid changed the retina's genetic instructions and generated red cones later in development.
""There still might be some randomness to it, but our big finding is that you make retinoic acid early in development,"" Johnston said. ""This timing really matters for learning and understanding how these cone cells are made.""
Green and red cone cells are remarkably similar except for a protein called opsin, which detects light and tells the brain what colors people see. Different opsins determine whether a cone will become a green or a red sensor, though the genes of each sensor remain 96% identical. With a breakthrough technique that spotted those subtle genetic differences in the organoids, the team tracked cone ratio changes over 200 days.

""Because we can control in organoids the population of green and red cells, we can kind of push the pool to be more green or more red,"" said author Sarah Hadyniak, who conducted the research as a doctoral student in Johnston's lab and is now at Duke University. ""That has implications for figuring out exactly how retinoic acid is acting on genes.""
The researchers also mapped the widely varying ratios of these cells in the retinas of 700 adults. Seeing how the green and red cone proportions changed in humans was one of the most surprising findings of the new research, Hadyniak said.
Scientists still don't fully understand how the ratio of green and red cones can vary so greatly without affecting someone's vision. If these types of cells determined the length of a human arm, the different ratios would produce ""amazingly different"" arm lengths, Johnston said.
To build understanding of diseases like macular degeneration, which causes loss of light-sensing cells near the center of the retina, the researchers are working with other Johns Hopkins labs. The goal is to deepen their understanding of how cones and other cells link to the nervous system.
""The future hope is to help people with these vision problems,"" Johnston said. ""It's going to be a little while before that happens, but just knowing that we can make these different cell types is very, very promising.""

In humans, great apes, and Old World monkeys, cones make a poorly understood choice between M and L cone subtype fates. To determine mechanisms specifying M and L cones, we developed an approach to visualize expression of the highly similar M- and L-opsin mRNAs. M-opsin was observed before L-opsin expression during early human eye development, suggesting that M cones are generated before L cones. In adult human tissue, the early-developing central retina contained a mix of M and L cones compared to the late-developing peripheral region, which contained a high proportion of L cones. Retinoic acid (RA)-synthesizing enzymes are highly expressed early in retinal development. High RA signaling early was sufficient to promote M cone fate and suppress L cone fate in retinal organoids. Across a human population sample, natural variation in the ratios of M and L cone subtypes was associated with a noncoding polymorphism in the NR2F2 gene, a mediator of RA signaling. Our data suggest that RA promotes M cone fate early in development to generate the pattern of M and L cones across the human retina."

The repair of damage to genetic material (DNA) in the human body is carried out by highly efficient mechanisms that have not yet been fully researched. A scientific team led by Christian Seiser from MedUni Vienna's Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology has now discovered a previously unrecognised control point for these processes. This could lead to a new approach for the development of cancer therapies aimed at inhibiting the repair of damaged cancer cells. The research work was recently published in the journal ""Nucleic Acids Research."" 

GSE1-CoREST is the name of the newly discovered complex, which contains three enzymes that control DNA repair processes and could form the basis for novel cancer therapeutics. ""In research, these proteins are already associated with cancer, but not in the context that we have now found,"" emphasises Christian Seiser, who led the study in close collaboration with researchers from the Max Perutz Labs Vienna. The new complex was identified as a controller of DNA repair processes using a precise measurement method (affinity purification mass spectrometry). ""This also showed that the inhibition of these enzymes can prevent the repair of genetic material and cause the death of cells,"" says first author Terezia Vcelkova from MedUni Vienna's Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology describing a highly desirable effect in tumour cells.
Stopping repair mechanisms
The genetic material, the DNA, is exposed to various harmful influences such as UV light or environmental pollutants on a daily basis. These influences can lead to changes in the DNA sequence, so-called mutations. To repair this damage to genetic material, various highly efficient biochemical repair mechanisms are normally activated. If these processes do not succeed in repairing the damage, programmed cell death (apoptosis) is ultimately initiated to protect against malignant cells.
To ensure their survival, cells react to DNA damage by activating and integrating signalling pathways or signalling cascades. This is achieved in particular through the activation of signalling pathways known as DNA damage response (or DDR). These signalling cascades are responsible for bringing repair factors to the right place in the genome at the right time in order to repair the mutated DNA efficiently and promptly. The control instances and regulators in this interaction are better defined thanks to the current research work. ""The effectiveness of the novel cancer therapeutics based on this, which are intended to improve the response of tumour cells to cancer therapies, is now being tested in preclinical studies,"" says Christian Seiser about the next steps.

By using affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) we discovered that genetic suppressor element 1 (GSE1) forms a complex with the HDAC1/CoREST deacetylase/demethylase co-repressor complex. In-depth phosphorylome analysis revealed that loss of GSE1 results in impaired DDR, ATR signalling and γH2AX formation upon DNA damage induction. Altered profiles of ATR target serine-glutamine motifs (SQ) on DDR-related hallmark proteins point to a defect in DNA damage sensing. In addition, GSE1 knock-out cells show hampered DNA damage-induced phosphorylation on SQ motifs of regulators of histone post-translational modifications, suggesting altered histone modification. While loss of GSE1 does not affect the histone deacetylation activity of CoREST, GSE1 appears to be essential for binding of the deubiquitinase USP22 to CoREST and for the deubiquitination of H2B K120 in response to DNA damage. The combination of deacetylase, demethylase, and deubiquitinase activity makes the USP22-GSE1-CoREST subcomplex a multi-enzymatic eraser that seems to play an important role during DDR. Since GSE1 has been previously associated with cancer progression and survival our findings are potentially of high medical relevance."

The effects of aging and external factors like UV exposure on skin are well documented. As people age or spend more time in the sun, their skin tends to become drier and more wrinkled,

Recent findings have identified an exciting potential new link to signs of skin aging -- the skin microbiome, the collection of microorganisms that inhabits our skin. The results come from a collaborative study carried out by researchers at the Center for Microbiome Innovation (CMI) at the University of California San Diego (UC San Diego) and L'Oréal Research and Innovation.
Their work was published in Frontiers in Aging on January 11, 2024, in an article entitled ""A multi-study analysis enables identification of potential microbial features associated with skin aging signs."" To the best of the team's knowledge, the study is the first to isolate microbes associated specifically with signs of skin aging and skin health, rather than chronological age.
Combining CMI's sophisticated data analysis abilities with L'Oréal's knowledge and expertise in skin health assessment, the study comprehensively examined data collected during 13 studies that L'Oréal had carried out in the past, consisting of 16S rRNA amplicon sequence data and corresponding skin clinical data for over 650 female participants, aged 18 -- 70. While each of the studies included in the analysis had focused on one particular area of interest -- for example, crow's feet wrinkles or moisture loss -- this multi-study analysis collated the data to search for trends related to specific microbes while accounting for other variables, such as age.
""Previous studies have shown that the types of microbes on our skin change fairly predictably with age,"" said corresponding author Se Jin Song, the CMI Director of Research. ""Our skin also changes physiologically with age; for example, we gain wrinkles and our skin gets drier. But there is variation in what this looks like in people -- you've probably noticed that there are some people who have younger or older looking skin than many others their age. Using advanced statistical methods, we were able to tease apart the microbes that are associated with these types of aging signs for skin, like crow's feet wrinkles, from those that are associated with simply age as a chronological number.""
Two notable trends emerged from the analysis. First, the team found a positive association between skin microbiome diversity and lateral cantonal lines (crow's feet wrinkles), which are generally viewed as one of the key signs of skin aging. Second, they observed a negative correlation between microbiome diversity and transepidermal water loss, which is the amount of moisture that evaporates through the skin. In further exploring the trends, the researchers identified several potential biomarkers that warrant investigation as microorganisms of interest. It would be premature to infer causation or actionable insights, but the study's results have provided researchers with directions on the next steps to hone in on better understanding microbial associations with skin aging.
""At L'Oréal, our commitment is to create beauty products that meet the unique needs of each individual. Our recent collaboration with the Center for Microbiome Innovation has shed light on the role of the skin microbiome in aging, particularly in how it affects wrinkles and overall skin quality,"" said co-author Qian Zheng, Head of Advanced Research, North America at L'Oréal. ""This research is groundbreaking in identifying new microbial biomarkers linked to visible signs of aging like crow's feet wrinkles. It marks a significant step towards developing technologies for healthier, more youthful skin. We look forward to sharing new results as they become available, furthering the scientific community's understanding and contributing to advancing new skincare solutions.""
Future paths of investigation the team has suggested include metabolomics work to discover chemical biomarkers related to skin aging, as well as meta-transcriptomics research into potential targets for genetic engineering. Research into other layers of the skin has also been considered, as many studies focus on the outer skin due to the ease of sample collection.

""While the study's findings represent an advance of our knowledge of the skin microbiome, we view them as just the beginning of a new phase of research,"" said co-author Rob Knight, the CMI Faculty Director and Professor of Pediatrics, Bioengineering, Computer Science & Engineering and Data Science at UC San Diego. ""By confirming a link between the microbiome and skin health, we've laid the groundwork for further studies that discover specific microbiome biomarkers related to skin aging, and, one day, show how to modify them to generate novel and highly targeted recommendations for skin health.""

The microbiome is an important factor to consider in aging since it constitutes most of the genes that are expressed on the human body. However, severity of specific aging signs (one of the parameters used to measure “apparent” age) and skin surface quality (e.g., texture, hydration, pH, sebum, etc.) may not be indicative of chronological age. For example, older individuals can have young looking skin (young apparent age) and young individuals can be of older apparent age. Methods: Here we aim to identify microbial taxa of interest associated to skin quality/aging signs using a multi-study analysis of 13 microbiome datasets consisting of 16S rRNA amplicon sequence data and paired skin clinical data from the face. Results: We show that there is a negative relationship between microbiome diversity and transepidermal water loss, and a positive association between microbiome diversity and age. Aligned with a tight link between age and wrinkles, we report a global positive association between microbiome diversity and Crow’s feet wrinkles, but with this relationship varying significantly by sub-study. Finally, we identify taxa potentially associated with wrinkles, TEWL and corneometer measures. Discussion: These findings represent a key step towards understanding the implication of the skin microbiota in skin aging signs."

Scientists have long known that some viruses and bacteria begin infections by latching first onto sugar molecules on the surfaces of cells lining the sinuses and throat of mammals, including humans. Viral particles, for instance, can attach to these molecules, called sialic acids, or SAs, like keys fitting into locks.

Now, a new study in infant mice shows that keeping virus particles from attaching to SAs limits more than just the entry of influenza A viral infections, but also hinders their exit (shedding) and transmission from mouse to mouse. Such infections are the main cause of the seasonal flu that kills more than 36,000 Americans annually. While vaccines to guard against infection and symptom treatments exist, they are not foolproof, scientists say, and more strategies are needed to prevent infection from spreading.
Led by researchers from NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the study team stripped away, or desialylated, SA receptors by placing directly into mouse nasal cavities a neuraminidase enzyme known to loosen the acids' ability to remain attached to cell surfaces. The infant mice were then infected with influenza A. Results showed treatment with the neuraminidase enzyme dramatically cut mouse-to-mouse transmission rates by more than half (from 51% to 100% ) in a half-dozen influenza strains tested.
Publishing in the American Society for Microbiology journal mBio online Jan.11, the work was conducted in infant mice, which unlike those even a few months older or adult mice, were found by the research team to have many sialic acids in the upper portion of their respiratory tract. Specifically, the team blocked two SAs, technically called alpha-2,3 SA and alpha-2,6 SA receptors (the locks). These are known to be widely present in the human respiratory tract, which researchers say makes infant mice a strong comparable model for studying the spread of the infectious disease in children, who are also recognized as important ""drivers"" of flu transmission among people.
""If further experiments in humans prove successful, desialylating neuraminidase enzymes may prevent the flu from spreading,"" said Ortigoza,"" said lead study investigator and infectious disease specialist Mila Ortigoza, MD. PhD.
""While current approaches with vaccines and treatments target the virus, ours is the first study to demonstrate that treating the host, either infected mice or potentially infected humans, to prevent them from transmitting the virus to another host could be another effective strategy for combating pervasive infectious diseases,"" said Ortigoza, who is also an assistant professor in the Departments of Medicine and Microbiology at NYU Langone.
Ortigoza cautions that extensive clinical research is needed before neuraminidases can be considered for approval as a treatment in humans. She says the team already has plans for more experiments to examine why infants are more susceptible to infection from respiratory viruses and whether blocking sialic acids in children can also prevent the spread of influenza.
Funding support for this study was provided by National Institutes of Health grants P30CA016087, S10OD021747, K08AI141759, and R01AI150893. Ansun Biopharma of San Diego, Calif., provided the experimental neuraminidase drug used in these experiments but was otherwise not involved in the study.
In addition to Ortigoza, other NYU Langone researchers involved in this study are Catherina Mobini; Hedy Rocha; Stacey Bartlett, PhD; Cynthia Loomis, MD, PhD; and Jeffrey Weiser, MD. Weiser is the Jan T. Vilcek Professor of Molecular Pathogenesis in the Department of Microbiology at NYU Langone Health and chair of the department.

IAV binds terminal sialic acids (SA) of sugar molecules present within the upper respiratory tract (URT) in order to successfully infect hosts. The two most common SA structures that are important for IAV infection are those with α2,3- and α2,6-linkages. While mice were once considered to be an unsuitable system for studying IAV transmission due to their lack of α2,6-SA in the trachea, we have successfully demonstrated that IAV transmission in infant mice is remarkably efficient. This finding led us to re-evaluate the SA composition of the URT of mice using in situ immunofluorescence and examine its in vivo contribution to transmission for the first time. We demonstrate that mice express both α2,3- and α2,6-SA in the URT and that the difference in expression between infants and adults contributes to the variable transmission efficiencies observed. Furthermore, selectively blocking α2,3-SA or α2,6-SA within the URT of infant mice using lectins was necessary but insufficient at inhibiting transmission, and simultaneous blockade of both receptors was crucial in achieving the desired inhibitory effect. By employing a broadly acting neuraminidase to indiscriminately remove both SA moieties in vivo , we effectively suppressed viral shedding and halted the transmission of different strains of influenza viruses. These results emphasize the utility of the infant mouse model for studying IAV transmission and strongly indicate that broadly targeting host SA is an effective approach that inhibits IAV contagion. Influenza virus transmission studies have historically focused on viral mutations that alter hemagglutinin binding to sialic acid (SA) receptors in vitro . However, SA binding preference does not fully account for the complexities of influenza A virus transmission in humans. Our previous findings reveal that viruses that are known to bind α2,6-SA in vitro have different transmission kinetics in vivo , suggesting that diverse SA interactions may occur during their life cycle. In this study, we examine the role of host SA on viral replication, shedding, and transmission in vivo . We highlight the critical role of SA presence during virus shedding, such that attachment to SA during virion egress is equally important as detachment from SA during virion release. These insights support the potential of broadly acting neuraminidases as therapeutic agents capable of restraining viral transmission in vivo . Our study unveils intricate virus-host interactions during shedding, highlighting the necessity to develop innovative strategies to effectively target transmission."

Florida's 156-mile-long Indian River Lagoon (IRL) borders five different counties and has five inlets that connect the lagoon with the Atlantic Ocean. In recent years, this estuary has experienced numerous phytoplankton bloom events due to increased seasonal temperatures coupled with environmental impacts.

Algal blooms produce a myriad of small organic molecules, many of which can be toxic to humans and animals. Among these phycotoxin producers is Microcystis aeruginosa, a freshwater cyanobacterium, which can be found in the Southern IRL. Measurable amounts of microcystins have been found in nasal swabs of people who live and work near the area, although finding microcystins in mucosal membranes may be evidence that the body is doing its job to eliminate them.
To help uncover potential human health hazards associated with harmful algae blooms in the IRL, researchers from Florida Atlantic University's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute collected water samples from 20 sites within the lagoon during wet and dry seasons over a three-year period. The samples were extracted to concentrate organic molecules and these extracts were used in testing. To identify the presence of known or emerging toxins, researchers used a panel of immortalized human cell lines corresponding to the liver, kidney and brain to measure cytotoxicity. Human cell lines engineered to express ion transporters, red blood cells, and the activity against a protein phosphatase enzyme, also were used in the study. These cells and biological activities were selected as they are known to be affected by algal toxins and show unique patterns of activity for known toxins.
Samples were tested at high concentrations to detect as many metabolites as possible, and those that presented more than 50 percent cytotoxicity were considered active. Samples that exhibited high toxicity were further subjected to liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry analysis to assess the metabolites present in the sample.
Results of the study, published in the journal Toxins, show that each control toxin induced a consistent pattern of cytotoxicity in the panel of human cell lines assayed. During blooms, cytotoxicity due to a single type of toxin was obvious from this pattern. In the absence of blooms, the observed cytotoxicity reflected either a mixture of toxins or it was caused by an unidentified toxin.
""The most interesting observation from our study is that with the cell lines used, we could follow the patterns of known toxins,"" said Esther Guzmán, Ph.D., corresponding author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch. ""Known toxins were seen only during blooms. Because cell toxicity was seen in the absence of blooms, it suggests that there might be either emergent toxins or a combination of toxins present at those times. Our findings suggest that other toxins with the potential to be harmful to human health may be present in the lagoon.""
Among the study findings, the most northern sites of the lagoon exhibited less toxicity than sites to the south. Cytotoxic blooms were seen both in the south (Microcystis) and the north (Pyrodinium) of the lagoon. In the absence of blooms, South Fork, South Fork 2, North Fork and Middle Estuary (sites one to four) in the Southern IRL and Banana River, and North Banana River (NASA) (sites 14 and 15) in the Northern IRL appeared to have the most cytotoxicity during the time of the assessment.

In contrast, Jensen, Fort Pierce Inlet, Harbor Branch Link Port Canal, Vero Beach Land/Ocean Biogeochemical Observatory, and Vero Beach Barber Bridge (sites six to 10) appeared healthier as there were few samples with cytotoxicity above 50 percent in these sites, although there was statistically significant variation in these sites.
""A major question we sought to answer in this study was whether there are unrecognized toxins or other signaling molecules associated with harmful algal blooms in the lagoon,"" said Amy Wright, Ph.D., co-author and a research professor, FAU Harbor Branch. ""The data collected to date suggest that this is indeed the case. Importantly, using an assay panel to assess the presence of toxic materials could allow for better monitoring of human health impacts, especially from emerging toxins within the system.""
The researchers note that microcystins are primarily a threat to human health in the lagoon during blooms, and because of the necessity of active transport, the toxin would need to be ingested or inhaled to present a threat to humans.
""Ingestion can be avoided by filtering water through activated charcoal,"" said Guzmán. ""Similarly, effects due to inhalation are effectively blocked by the mucus membrane, which traps toxins that are subsequently eliminated through coughing. However, pet and wildlife exposures can still occur.""

This study aimed to gather data on the toxicity to human cells and to identify secondary metabolites found in water samples collected in the IRL. Water samples from 20 sites of the IRL were collected during the wet and dry seasons over a three-year period. A panel of cell lines was used to test cytotoxicity. Hemagglutination, hemolysis, and inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) were also measured. Cytotoxic blooms were seen both in the south (Microcystis) and the north (Pyrodinium) of the IRL. Each toxin induced a consistent pattern of cytotoxicity in the panel of human cell lines assayed. During blooms, cytotoxicity due to a single type of toxin is obvious from this pattern. In the absence of blooms, the cytotoxicity seen reflected either a mixture of toxins or it was caused by an unidentified toxin. These observations suggest that other toxins with the potential to be harmful to human health may be present in the IRL. Moreover, the presence of toxins in the IRL is not always associated with blooms of known toxin-producing organisms."

If you've ever taken a car trip through a rural area, you might already know that livestock, including cows and sheep, can be individually tracked using decidedly old-fashioned methods, such as ear tags or even branding marks. By contrast, many tech-savvy pet owners have opted to have their dog or cat ""chipped"" by having a radio frequency identification (RFID) permanently implanted under the skin. However, all these identification solutions leave something to be desired, as ear tags can become damaged or lost, while RFID chips require an invasive procedure to insert and specialized equipment to read.

In a study recently published in Scientific Reports, researchers from the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo demonstrated an alternative ""bio-tagging"" method, in which a unique array of microneedles -- with alphanumeric characters visible to the unaided eye -- is directly inserted into the skin for permanent identification of animals. This approach relies on a patch of dissolvable microneedle arrays to deliver the dye molecules. ""We feel that our method is a simpler, safer, and more humane way to label animals, and is versatile enough to be applied both in pets and industrial situations,"" lead author of the study, Jongho Park says.
The researchers used microneedle array patches (MAPs), in which microneedle arrays, less than 1 mm long, are created in the form of a matrix from customized polydimethylsiloxane molds. By altering the molds, desired symbols can be tattooed into the animal, like the output of dot-matrix printers. The negative molds themselves can be made easily from positive 3D-printed resin plugs. ""Our MAPs approach allows for a very large number of unique identifiers, and does not require much specialized training to apply,"" says senior author, Beomjoon Kim.
Testing showed that the biotags remained clearly legible in the skin over a month after being stamped. This technique can be a useful tool for animal research and management, as well as potentially being extended biomedical applications and other areas such as flexible electronics integration.

Thus, identifying individual animals, including their possessions, and adequately managing each animal is necessary.

In this study, we proposed a new biotagging method using a microneedle array for animal identification. Our approach uses dissolvable microneedle arrays as a single patch to deliver dyes directly into the skin layer. Additionally, we developed a new fabrication method for customised female moulds to realise microneedle array patches (MAPs) with patterns of different characters and number. The characteristics and feasibility of the patterned MAPs were confirmed through basic evaluations and animal experiments. Moreover, we confirmed that patterns formed from biotagging using the developed patterned MAPs lasted over one month with clear readability. Finally, we confirmed that our patterned MAPs successfully realised biotagging on rat skin with the designated patterns including characters and number patterns. The proposed method is expected to enable minimally invasive tagging without external equipment or complex processes. In addition, the developed method could be used to embed various tags into the skin of animals and humans in the future."

The release of low-molecular weight carboxylates, such as malate, is used by many plant species to mine poorly available phosphorus (P) from the soil. Malate can increase the availability of phosphate, the P form taken up by plants, by chelating trivalent aluminium or iron (Fe). Work in the last years has demonstrated that the accumulation of Fe(III)-malate complexes in the apoplast of root tips attenuates root growth under low-P conditions because the now soluble Fe(III) (ferric Fe) participates in reactions leading to oxidative stress. However, how root tips cope with this increased ferric Fe availability has remained elusive as all currently known ferric reductases, which are required for Fe uptake, are repressed in response to P deficiency or not expressed in root tips.

""By searching for other potential ferric reductases among P deficiency-induced genes, we found a previously uncharacterized gene encoding a domain predicted to participate in ferric reduction,"" explains Dr. Ricardo Giehl, co-leader of IPK's research group ""Molecular Plant Nutrition."" ""When we disrupted this gene, Fe over accumulated in root tips and root growth under low P was even more severely inhibited.""
The gene was, therefore, named HYPERSENSITIVE TO LOW P1 (HYP1). HYP1 is a member of the CYBDOM family and possesses a cytochrome b561 domain, which is common in several ferric reductases active in animal cells, such as the duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb) involved with dietary Fe uptake in humans. ""Although CYBDOMs are ubiquitous in several organisms and come typically as large families in plants, their function in any organism is still poorly understood,"" explains Rodolfo Maniero, first author of the study.
Using AlphaFold-supported modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, the researchers found that HYP1 can coordinate three b-hemes, which are critical for the protein's activity. Electrophysiological characterization of HYP1 in oocytes revealed that the protein can transport electrons derived from ascorbate (vitamin C) across the plasma membrane. Acceptors of these electrons are Fe(III) and Cu(II) (cupric ion), indicating that the protein is a metalloreductase.
""Regarding the ferric reductase activity of HYP1, our results demonstrate that this function is critical to prevent malate-induced Fe overaccumulation in the apoplast and to maintain cell elongation and meristem integrity in root tips exposed to low P,"" explains Dr. Ricardo Giehl. ""Our results also suggested that an Fe-uptake mechanism is active in root tips, where the well-known ferric reductase FRO2 and the Fe(II) transporter IRT1 are not present,"" says the IPK scientist. ""Our study not only shed light on the physiological roles of CYBDOMs but also identified a new target to improve root growth under limiting-P conditions.""

In the presence of Fe, malate can provoke Fe over-accumulation in the root apoplast, triggering a series of events that inhibit root growth. Here, we identified HYPERSENSITIVE TO LOW P1 (HYP1), a CYBDOM protein constituted of a DOMON and a cytochrome b561 domain, as critical to maintain cell elongation and meristem integrity under low P. We demonstrate that HYP1 mediates ascorbate-dependent trans-plasma membrane electron transport and can reduce ferric and cupric substrates in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in planta. HYP1 expression is up-regulated in response to P deficiency in the proximal zone of the root apical meristem. Disruption of HYP1 leads to increased Fe and callose accumulation in the root meristem and causes significant transcriptional changes in roots. We further demonstrate that HYP1 activity overcomes malate-induced Fe accumulation, thereby preventing Fe-dependent root growth arrest in response to low P. Collectively, our results uncover an ascorbate-dependent metalloreductase that is critical to protect root meristems of P-deficient plants from increased Fe availability and provide insights into the physiological function of the yet poorly characterized but ubiquitous CYBDOM proteins."

Hummingbirds use two distinct sensory strategies to control their flight, depending on whether they're hovering or in forward motion, according to new research by University of British Columbia (UBC) zoologists.

""When in forward fight, hummingbirds rely on what we call an 'internal forward model' -- almost an ingrained, intuitive autopilot -- to gauge speed,"" says Dr. Vikram B. Baliga, lead author of a new study on hummingbird locomotion published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. ""There's just too much information coming in to rely directly on every visual cue from your surroundings.""
""But when hovering or dealing with cues that might require a change in altitude, we found they rely much more on real-time, direct visual feedback from their environment.""
The findings not only provide insights on how the tiny, agile birds perceive the world during transitions in flight, but could inform the programming of onboard navigation for next generation autonomous flying and hovering vehicles.
Hummingbird flight recorder
The researchers had hummingbirds perform repeated flights from a perch to a feeder in a four-metre tunnel. To test how the birds reacted to a variety of visual stimuli, the team projected patterns on the chamber's front and side walls. Each flight was videoed.
In some scenarios, the researchers projected vertical stripes moving at various speeds on the side walls to mimic degrees of forward motion. Sometimes, horizontal stripes on the side mimicked changes in altitude. On the front wall, the researchers projected rotating swirls, designed to create the illusion of a change in position.
""If the birds were taking their cues directly from visual stimuli, we'd expect them to adjust their forward velocity to the speed of vertical stripes on the side walls,"" says Dr. Baliga. ""But while the birds did change velocity or stop altogether depending on the patterns, there wasn't a neat correlation.""
However, during flight, the hummingbirds did adjust more directly to stimuli indicating a change in altitude. And during hovering, the birds also worked to adjust their position much more closely to shifting spirals the research team projected on the front wall.
""Our experiments were designed to investigate how hummingbirds control flight speed,"" says Dr. Doug Altshuler, senior author on the paper. ""But because the hummingbirds took spontaneous breaks to hover during their flights, we uncovered these two distinct strategies to control different aspects of their trajectories.""

Previous work in hummingbirds has separately examined the roles of optic flow during hovering and when centring through a narrow passage during forward flight. To develop a hypothesis for the visual control of forward flight velocity, we examined the behaviour of hummingbirds in a flight tunnel where optic flow could be systematically manipulated. In all treatments, the animals exhibited periods of forward flight interspersed with bouts of spontaneous hovering. Hummingbirds flew fastest when they had a reliable signal of optic flow. All optic flow manipulations caused slower flight, suggesting that hummingbirds had an expected optic flow magnitude that was disrupted. In addition, upward and downward optic flow drove optomotor responses for maintaining altitude during forward flight. When hummingbirds made voluntary transitions to hovering, optomotor responses were observed to all directions. Collectively, these results are consistent with hummingbirds controlling flight speed via mechanisms that use an internal forward model to predict expected optic flow whereas flight altitude and hovering position are controlled more directly by sensory feedback from the environment."

A new study shows that human hunting and land use have a decisive influence on red deer density in Europe. Red deer density is only reduced when wolves, lynx and bears co-occur at the same site.

Alongside the occasional bison and elk, red deer are Europe's largest native wild animal. An international study led by wildlife ecologists from the University of Freiburg has now investigated the factors that affect the red deer population in a particular area.
The researchers were able to show that the population density of the animals in Europe is primarily influenced by human hunting and land use and not by large predators such as wolves, lynx and brown bears. ""While large carnivores are often considered key factors in controlling prey populations in undisturbed ecosystems, this is less visible in human-dominated landscapes. Our study illustrates that these interactions are context-dependent,"" says Dr. Suzanne T. S. van Beeck Calkoen, former PhD student at the Chair of Wildlife Ecology and Management at the University of Freiburg and first author of the study.
The researchers collected data on the population density of red deer at over 492 study sites in 28 European countries and analysed the influence of various factors such as habitat productivity, the presence of large carnivores, human activities, climatic variables and the protection status of the area. The evaluation of the data showed that human hunting reduced red deer density more than the presence of all large carnivores. Human land use, on the other hand, led to an increase in red deer density. In most cases, the presence of large carnivores had no statistically significant effect on the red deer population. Only when the three predators wolf, lynx and bear occurred together in one area did the number of red deer decrease. However, the study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology did not investigate how the presence of predators affects the behavior of red deer.
The return of the wolf 
The study also sheds new light on the ongoing debate about the return of the wolf to Central Europe, notes Prof. Dr. Marco Heurich, Professor of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Biology at the Faculty of Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Freiburg and initiator of the study. ""Our research shows that the return of a large carnivore such as the wolf alone does not have a major impact on the occurrence of red deer. This is because in Central Europe, human influences predominate both indirectly through interventions in the red deer's habitat and directly through the killing of the animals."" In addition, the mortality rate of wolves in Central European landscapes is very high, mainly due to road traffic, which further limits their influence on prey populations. ""However, we also found a high variability in red deer densities, which indicates that there may be specific situations in which large carnivores do have an impact. Investigating this will be the task of future studies,"" states Heurich.

The ocean contains about 60 times more carbon than the atmosphere, in part due to a key process in the marine carbon cycle called the biological carbon pump (BCP). In this process, carbon dioxide (CO2) is converted to organic matter through photosynthesis and subsequently sinks as the so-called ""export flux"" from the surface ocean waters to the deep sea. As it sinks, bacterial decomposition processes break down the organic matter back into inorganic carbon, thus storing CO2 in the interior ocean. The BCP keeps atmospheric CO2 levels significantly lower than they would be in a hypothetical world without the BCP. So far, so good.

But one crucial aspect is often overlooked, says Dr Ivy Frenger, a climate researcher at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel: ""You have to consider the ocean circulation, because it determines how much of the biologically produced CO2 can actually accumulate in the interior ocean in the long term, isolated from exchange with the atmosphere."" Looking at the effect of the BCP only in terms of the export flux is like trying to explain the balance of a bank account by looking only at the deposits. ""But there are gains and losses.""
Changes in the BCP are an important research topic in the context of climate change. Ivy Frenger notes that when considering the impact of the BCP on atmospheric CO2, it is common to focus on the export flux and neglect the ocean circulation. She and six international colleagues have therefore published an opinion paper entitled ""Misconceptions of the marine biological carbon pump in a changing climate: Thinking outside the 'export' box.""
In their paper, the scientists aim to address the misconception that there is a direct link between the global export flux -- equivalent to deposits -- and the biogenic storage of CO2 in the ocean, and hence, atmospheric CO2 -- the equivalent to the bank account balance. ""There is no such simple correlation,"" says Dr Frenger. The ""withdrawal"" side also needs to be taken into account.
A much simpler and scientifically more accurate approach, she says, would be to directly estimate the CO2 reservoir resulting from biological processes in the interior ocean. Such an estimate can be made by measuring the oxygen content of the ocean's interior along with its physical state, such as temperature. Changes in these variables under climate change would also explain a seemingly paradoxical response of the BCP under anthropogenic climate change: Despite a decreasing export flux, carbon storage due to the biological pump in the interior ocean increases. This is because changes in ocean circulation delay the return of biologically stored carbon from the ocean interior to the surface. As in the bank account analogy: while the deposits are lower, if the withdrawals are reduced to an even greater extent there will be a net increase. Accordingly, for climate change, this feedback results in more CO2 being stored in the ocean's interior than would be the case without the biological carbon pump. Co-author Angela Landolfi remarks: ""It is important to note that this effect is small when compared to the continuing massive anthropogenic CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.""
The scientists hope that their opinion paper and proposed approach will contribute to a clearer understanding of the influence of the marine biological carbon pump on atmospheric CO2 in a changing world. A broader view of the biological carbon pump is particularly important for proposals to remove CO2 from the atmosphere through marine CDR approaches, such as artificially stimulating marine biology.

As the BCP commonly is equated with the flux of organic material to the ocean interior, termed “export flux,” a change in export flux is perceived to directly impact atmospheric CO2, and thus climate. Here, we recap how this perception contrasts with current understanding of the BCP, emphasizing the lack of a direct relationship between global export flux and atmospheric CO2. We argue for the use of the storage of carbon of biological origin in the ocean interior as a diagnostic that directly relates to atmospheric CO2, as a way forward to quantify the changes in the BCP in a changing climate. The diagnostic is conveniently applicable to both climate model data and increasingly available observational data. It can explain a seemingly paradoxical response under anthropogenic climate change: Despite a decrease in export flux, the BCP intensifies due to a longer reemergence time of biogenically stored carbon back to the ocean surface and thereby provides a negative feedback to increasing atmospheric CO2. This feedback is notably small compared with anthropogenic CO2 emissions and other carbon‐climate feedbacks. In this Opinion paper, we advocate for a comprehensive view of the BCP's impact on atmospheric CO2, providing a prerequisite for assessing the effectiveness of marine CO2 removal approaches that target marine biology."

Peatlands are affected more by drought than expected. This is concerning, as these ecosystems are an important ally in the fight against climate change. Following long periods of drought, peat is able to absorb little to no extra carbon (CO2). Increasing biodiversity also does little to make peat more drought-resilient. These are the conclusions drawn by researchers from Radboud University in a publication appearing today in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Peat is a vast carbon sink: per square metre it is able to store more CO2 than any other ecosystem in the world. The peatlands of the Netherlands, but also those in places such as Scandinavia and the Baltic states, therefore play an important role in the fight against climate change. However, peat is coming under increasing pressure and is extremely sensitive to the dry summers we are experiencing as a result of climate change. This is what researchers from the Radboud Institute for Biological and Environmental Sciences have concluded.
'In our lab, under controlled conditions, we first ensured that large blocks of peat were well moistened over a long period of time', explains lead author Bjorn Robroek. 'We then slowly dried the peat out. One half was exposed to mild drought, with the water level roughly five centimetres lower than the peat itself. The other half was subjected to extreme drought conditions; in this case the water was twenty centimetres below the peat. This is comparable to a period of three weeks without rain -- something that has also become increasingly common in the Netherlands in recent years.'
These experiments revealed that peat exposed to mild drought still absorbs a reasonable amount of carbon. Robroek: 'Under extreme drought conditions, however, the peat can hardly take on any more carbon. In the event of an extended period of drought it even releases the carbon again.'
Biodiversity
Drought not only affects peatlands, of course. Dry summers have made other ecosystems more fragile too. However, in the case of grasslands, for example, we now have methods to combat problems caused by drought. Increasing the biodiversity in this kind of ecosystem (by incorporating a greater number of different plants), as in the case of the Future Dikes project, keeps the ecosystem healthy and resilient.
Nevertheless, according to Robroek, when it comes to peatlands, improving biodiversity in this way is of little use in terms of tackling drought. 'The different mosses that we tested in our peat experiments do little to nothing to combat drought. That does not mean that biodiversity is not important for peat: it helps with carbon storage, for example. But in the battle against drought a different approach is needed.'
Politics
There are little things that consumers can do to protect peat. 'Buy peat-free potting substrate and compost, for example', cautions Robroek. 'In the end, however, this is mainly a problem that will have to be solved at political level. In the past the buffer zones alongside rivers often consisted of peatland, but today much of this is grassland intended for agricultural use. These areas are constantly mowed and ploughed and therefore hardly retain any water. As a result, water from these floodplains drains more quickly into the rivers, causing flooding.'
'Switching over to natural management methods costs time and money, but will have huge benefits in the future. Peatlands, even lowland peat areas, will then retain considerably more water and therefore offer much better protection. You could compare this to a sponge that gradually releases water back to the landscape. In such places peat is also the most effective option when it comes to storing carbon.'

An open question in ecosystem ecology is whether assemblages of co-occurring peat mosses contribute to the stability of peatland ecosystem processes. We conducted a two-species ( Sphagnum cuspidatum , Sphagnum medium ) replacement series mesocosm experiment to evaluate the resistance, resilience, and recovery rates of net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) under mild and deep water table drawdown. Our results show a positive effect of mild water table drawdown on NEE with no apparent role for peat moss mixture. Our study indicates that the carbon uptake capacity by peat moss mixtures is rather resilient to mild water table drawdown, but seriously affected by deeper drought conditions. Co-occurring peat moss species seem to enhance the resilience of the carbon uptake function (i.e. ability of NEE to return to pre-perturbation levels) of peat moss mixtures only slightly. These findings suggest that assemblages of co-occurring Sphagnum mosses do only marginally contribute to the stability of ecosystem functions in peatlands under drought conditions. Above all, our results highlight that predicted severe droughts can gravely affect the sink capacity of peatlands, with only a small extenuating role for peat moss mixtures."

Giants once roamed the karst plains of southern China, three-metre tall apes weighing in at 250 kilograms. These very distant human ancestors - Gigantopithcus blacki - went extinct before humans arrived in the region, with few clues to why, and so far leaving around 2000 fossilised teeth and four jawbones as the only signs of their existence.

New evidence from this region published in Nature, uncovered by a team of Chinese, Australian and US researchers, demonstrates beyond doubt that the largest primate to walk the earth went extinct between 295,000 and 215,000 years ago, unable to adapt its food preferences and behaviours, and vulnerable to the changing climates which sealed its fate.
""The story of G. blacki is an enigma in palaeontology - how could such a mighty creature go extinct at a time when other primates were adapting and surviving? The unresolved cause of its disappearance has become the Holy Grail in this discipline,"" says palaeontologist and co-lead author Professor Yingqi Zhang, from the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IVPP).
""The IVPP has been excavating for G. blacki evidence in this region for over 10 years but without solid dating and a consistent environmental analysis, the cause of its extinction had eluded us.""
Definitive evidence revealing the story of the giant ape's extinction has come from a large-scale project collecting evidence from 22 cave sites spread across a wide region of Guangxi Province in southern China. The foundation of this study was the dating.
""It's a major feat to present a defined cause for the extinction of a species, but establishing the exact time when a species disappears from the fossil record gives us a target timeframe for an environmental reconstruction and behaviour assessment,"" says co-lead author, Macquarie University geochronologist Associate Professor Kira Westaway.
""Without robust dating, you are simply looking for clues in the wrong places.""
Six Australian universities contributed to the project. Macquarie University, Southern Cross University, Wollongong University and the University of Queensland used multiple techniques to date samples. Southern Cross also mapped G. blacki teeth to extract information on the apes' behaviours. ANU and Flinders University studied the pollen and fossil bearing sediments in the cave respectively, to reconstruct the environments in which G. blacki thrived and then disappeared.

Six different dating techniques were applied to the cave sediments and fossils, producing 157 radiometric ages. These were combined with eight sources of environmental and behavioural evidence, and applied to 11 caves containing evidence of G blacki, and also to 11 caves of a similar age range where no G. blacki evidence was found.
Luminescence dating, which measures a light-sensitive signal found in the burial sediments that encased the G. blacki fossils, was the primary technique, supported by uranium series (US) and electron-spin resonance (US-ESR) dating of the G. blacki teeth themselves.
""By direct-dating the fossil remains, we confirmed their age aligns with the luminescence sequence in the sediments where they were found, giving us a comprehensive and reliable chronology for the extinction of G. blacki,"" says Southern Cross University geochronologist Associate Professor Renaud Joannes-Boyau.
Using detailed pollen analysis, fauna reconstructions, stable isotope analysis of the teeth and a detailed analysis of the cave sediments at a micro level, the team established the environmental conditions leading up to when G blacki went extinct. Then, using trace element and dental microwear textural analysis (DMTA) of the apes' teeth, the team modelled G. blacki's behaviour while it was flourishing, compared to during the species' demise.
""Teeth provide a staggering insight into the behaviour of the species indicating stress, diversity of food sources, and repeated behaviours,"" says Associate Professor Joannes-Boyau
The findings show G.blacki went extinct between 295,000 and 215,000 years ago, much earlier than previously assumed. Before this time, G. blacki flourished in a rich and diverse forest.

By 700,000 to 600,000 years ago, the environment became more variable due to the increase in the strength of the seasons, causing a change in the structure of the forest communities.
Orangutans (genus Pongo) - a close relative of G. blacki - adapted their size, behaviour and habitat preferences as conditions changed. In comparison, G. blacki relied on a less nutritious back up food source when its preferences were unavailable, decreasing the diversity of its food. The ape became less mobile, had a reduced geographic range for foraging, and faced chronic stress and dwindling numbers.
""G. blacki was the ultimate specialist, compared to the more agile adapters like orangutans, and this ultimately led to its demise,"" says Professor Zhang.
Associate Professor Westaway says: ""With the threat of a sixth mass extinction event looming over us, there is an urgent need to understand why species go extinct.
""Exploring the reasons for past unresolved extinctions gives us a good starting point to understand primate resilience and the fate of other large animals, in the past and future.""

We used 157 radiometric ages from six dating techniques to establish a timeline for the demise of G. blacki. We show that from 2.3 million years ago the environment was a mosaic of forests and grasses, providing ideal conditions for thriving G. blacki populations. However, just before and during the extinction window between 295,000 and 215,000 years ago there was enhanced environmental variability from increased seasonality, which caused changes in plant communities and an increase in open forest environments. Although its close relative Pongo weidenreichi managed to adapt its dietary preferences and behaviour to this variability, G. blacki showed signs of chronic stress and dwindling populations. Ultimately its struggle to adapt led to the extinction of the greatest primate to ever inhabit the Earth."

A major international collaboration of 356 scientists led by UCL researchers has found almost identical patterns of tree diversity across the world's tropical forests.

The study of over one million trees across 1,568 locations, published in Nature, found that just 2.2% of tree species make up 50% of the total number of trees in tropical forests across Africa, the Amazon, and Southeast Asia. Each continent consists of the same proportion of a few common species and many rare species.
While tropical forests are famous for their diversity, this is the first time that scientists have studied the commonest trees in the world's tropical forests.
The scientists estimate that just 1,053 species account for half of the planet's 800 billion tropical forest trees. The other half are comprised of 46,000 tree species. The number of rare species is extreme, with the rarest 39,500 species accounting for just 10% of trees.
Lead author Dr Declan Cooper (UCL Geography and UCL Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research) said: ""Our findings have profound implications for understanding tropical forests. If we focus on understanding the commonest tree species, we can probably predict how the whole forest will respond to today's rapid environmental changes. This is especially important because tropical forests contain a tremendous amount of stored carbon, and are a globally important carbon sink.""
He continued: ""Identifying the prevalence of the most common species gives scientists a new way of looking at tropical forests. Tracking these common species may provide a new way to characterise these forests and in the future possibly gauge a forest's health more easily.""
The researchers found strikingly similar patterns in the proportion of tree species that are common, at close to 2.2%, despite the tropical forests of the Amazon, Africa and Southeast Asia each having a unique history and differing contemporary environments.

The Amazon consists of a large region of connected forest, while Southeast Asia is a region of mostly disconnected islands. People only arrived in the Amazon around 20,000 years ago, but people have been living in African and Southeast Asian forests for more than twice that length of time. In terms of the contemporary environment, African forests experience a drier and cooler climate than the other two tropical forest regions.
Given these striking differences, the near-identical patterns of tree diversity suggests that a fundamental mechanism may govern the assembly of tree communities across all the world's tropical forests. The researchers are not yet able to say what that mechanism might be and it will focus future work on identifying it.
The estimates of common species derive from statistical analyses, which does not provide the names of the common trees. To overcome this, the scientists used a technique known as resampling to estimate which are the most likely names of the common species. Their list of 1,119 tree species names, the first list of common species of the world's tropical forests, will allow researchers to focus their efforts on understanding the ecology of these species, which in turn can give scientists a short-cut to understand the whole forest.
See table below for a list of the most common tropical tree species.
Senior author, Professor Simon Lewis (UCL Geography and University of Leeds) said: ""We wanted to look at tropical forests in a new way. Focusing on a few hundred common tree species on each continent, rather than the many thousands of species that we know almost nothing about, can open new ways to understand these precious forests. This focus on the commonest species should not take away from the importance of rare species. Rare species need special attention to protect them, but quick and important gains in knowledge will come from a scientific focus on the commonest tree species.""
The researchers assembled forest inventory data from intact tropical forests that hadn't been affected by logging or fire. In each of 1,568 locations, teams identified and recorded every tree with a trunk greater than 10 centimetres in diameter, in a patch of forest, usually one hectare, which is a square of forest measuring 100 metres on each side.
Professor Lewis has been collecting and collating this data for 20 years. The effort is a collaboration of the largest plot networks across the Amazon (Amazon Tree Diversity Network; RAINFOR), Africa (African Tropical Rainforest Observatory Network, AfriTRON; Central African Plot Network), and Southeast Asia (Slik Diversity Network; T-FORCES), brought together for the first time for the published analysis.
This collaboration across hundreds of researchers, field assistants, and local communities resulted in a total of 1,003,805 trees sampled, which included 8,493 tree species, across 2,048 hectares, equivalent to almost eight square miles of forest. The teams inventoried 1,097 plots in the Amazon totalling 1,434 hectares, 368 plots in Africa totalling 450 hectares, and 103 plots in Southeast Asia totalling 164 hectares.
This research was supported by the Natural Environmental Research Council.

The vast number of tree species presents a formidable challenge to understanding these forests, including their response to environmental change, as very little is known about most tropical tree species. A focus on the common species may circumvent this challenge. Here we investigate abundance patterns of common tree species using inventory data on 1,003,805 trees with trunk diameters of at least 10 cm across 1,568 locations1–6 in closed-canopy, structurally intact old-growth tropical forests in Africa, Amazonia and Southeast Asia. We estimate that 2.2%, 2.2% and 2.3% of species comprise 50% of the tropical trees in these regions, respectively. Extrapolating across all closed-canopy tropical forests, we estimate that just 1,053 species comprise half of Earth’s 800 billion tropical trees with trunk diameters of at least 10 cm. Despite differing biogeographic, climatic and anthropogenic histories7, we find notably consistent patterns of common species and species abundance distributions across the continents. This suggests that fundamental mechanisms of tree community assembly may apply to all tropical forests. Resampling analyses show that the most common species are likely to belong to a manageable list of known species, enabling targeted efforts to understand their ecology. Although they do not detract from the importance of rare species, our results open new opportunities to understand the world’s most diverse forests, including modelling their response to environmental change, by focusing on the common species that constitute the majority of their trees."

From intensifying wildfires to record-breaking floods year on year, the effects of climate change have manifested in devastating outcomes on ecosystems that threaten species all over the world. One such ecosystem in peril is coral reefs, which play a major role in sustaining biodiversity in the planet's oceans but are facing increasingly severe conditions as waters heat up leading to a phenomenon known as marine heat waves.

For nearly a decade, Katie Barott, assistant professor of biology at the University of Pennsylvania, has led a collaborative team of researchers studying two coral species in Hawaii to better understand their adaptability to the effects of climate change. Their recent paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences sheds light on this issue, revealing the complex and varied ways corals are adapting, or struggling to adapt, to the rapidly changing oceanic environment.
""We tracked more than 40 large coral colonies over 10 years and found that certain species have an improved ability to endure and recover from subsequent marine heat waves after surviving one such event,"" Barott says. ""It's a bit like working out; the more often you exercise, the easier it is to go through the same exercise stress.""
The researchers studied two dominant coral species in Kaneohe Bay in Oahu, Hawaii: rice coral, Montipora capitata, and finger coral, Porites compressa. Over the decade, these corals were subjected to significant marine heat waves in 2014, 2015, and 2019. These provided a unique opportunity to identify bleaching-resistant and bleaching-susceptible individuals of each species and then observe their responses to repeated heat stress. Their findings highlight the resilience of some corals while underscoring the vulnerability of others.
""One of our key discoveries is the role of ""acclimatization,"" says Kristen Brown, first author of the paper and a postdoctoral researcher in the Barott Lab. ""This refers to the ability of some corals to adjust to higher temperatures, thereby reducing their susceptibility to bleaching, a phenomenon wherein corals expel the algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn white and increasing the risk of death.""
The researchers found that bleaching-resistant individuals of both coral species remained pigmented throughout the study period, suggesting a persistent form of thermal tolerance; however, pigmentation alone was not a definitive indicator of overall health or resilience.
The researchers reveal contrasting recovery patterns between the bleaching-susceptible individuals of each species following the heat waves. Montipora capitata, despite some evidence of acclimatization, repeatedly experienced bleaching and showed significant mortality for as long as three years after the last heat wave; conversely, initially sensitive individuals of Porites compressa exhibited a remarkable capacity for recovery and acclimatization, with no bleaching or mortality during the third heat wave and most physiological metrics returning to normal within one year. This difference underscores a critical aspect of coral resilience: the ability to not only survive heat stress but to effectively recover from it.
The researchers suggest that coral responses to climate change are diverse and complex, influenced by a range of factors, including species-specific characteristics and past exposure to environmental stressors. And, as a next step, the team plans to continue monitoring and exploring aspects like coral growth, calcification, and the impacts of recurring marine heatwaves.

Corals that survive these extreme events must rapidly recover if they are to withstand subsequent events, and long-term survival in the face of rising ocean temperatures may hinge on recovery capacity and acclimatory gains in heat tolerance over an individual’s lifespan. To better understand coral recovery trajectories in the face of successive marine heatwaves, we monitored the responses of bleaching-susceptible and bleaching-resistant individuals of two dominant coral species in Hawai’i, Montipora capitata and Porites compressa , over a decade that included three marine heatwaves. Bleaching-susceptible colonies of P. compressa exhibited beneficial acclimatization to heat stress (i.e., less bleaching) following repeat heatwaves, becoming indistinguishable from bleaching-resistant conspecifics during the third heatwave. In contrast, bleaching-susceptible M. capitata repeatedly bleached during all successive heatwaves and exhibited seasonal bleaching and substantial mortality for up to 3 y following the third heatwave. Encouragingly, bleaching-resistant individuals of both species remained pigmented across the entire time series; however, pigmentation did not necessarily indicate physiological resilience. Specifically, M. capitata displayed incremental yet only partial recovery of symbiont density and tissue biomass across both bleaching phenotypes up to 35 mo following the third heatwave as well as considerable partial mortality. Conversely, P. compressa appeared to recover across most physiological metrics within 2 y and experienced little to no mortality. Ultimately, these results indicate that even some visually robust, bleaching-resistant corals can carry the cost of recurring heatwaves over multiple years, leading to divergent recovery trajectories that may erode coral reef resilience in the Anthropocene."

A research paper published in Royal Society's Biology Letters on January 10 has revealed that picrodontids -- an extinct family of placental mammals that lived several million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs -- are not primates as previously believed.

The paper -- co-authored by Jordan Crowell, an Anthropology Ph.D. candidate at the CUNY Graduate Center; Stephen Chester, an Associate Professor of Anthropology at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center; and John Wible, Curator of Mammals at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History -- is significant in that it settled a paleontological debate that has been brewing for over 100 years while helping to paint a more clear picture of primate evolution.
For the last 50 years, paleontologists have believed picrodontids, which were no larger than a mouse and likely ate foods such as fruit, nectar, and pollen, were primates, based on features of their teeth that they share with living primates. But by using modern CT scan technology to analyze the only known preserved picrodontid skull in Brooklyn College's Mammalian Evolutionary Morphology Laboratory, Crowell, the lead author on the paper, worked with Chester, the paper's senior author, and Wible to determine they are not closely related to primates at all.
""While picrodontids share features of their teeth with living primates, the bones of the skull, specifically the bone that surrounds the ear, are unlike that of any living primate or close fossil relatives of primates,"" Crowell said. ""This suggests picrodontids and primates independently evolved similarities of their teeth likely for similar diets. This study also highlights the importance of revisiting old specimens with updated techniques to examine them.""
Chester, who serves as Crowell's Ph.D. adviser, has both a professional and personal interest in this research. It was Chester's colleague and ""academic grandfather,"" Professor Emeritus Frederick Szalay from CUNY's Hunter College and the Graduate Center, who in 1968 first convincingly classified picrodontids as primates based on evidence from fossilized teeth. Szalay studied the teeth of the only known picrodontid skull, Zanycteris paleocenus, for his research -- the same skull this team examined with the new technology that led to their discovery.
""The Zanycteris cranium was prepared and partially submerged in plaster around 1917, so researchers studying this important specimen at the American Museum of Natural History were not aware of how much cranial anatomy was hidden over the last 100 years"" Chester said. ""Micro-CT scanning has revolutionized the field of paleontology and allows researchers to discover so much more about previously studied fossils housed in natural history museum collections.""
The research was funded by grants Chester and Crowell secured through Brooklyn College from the National Science Foundation and The Leakey Foundation. Chester and Crowell are also currently working on several additional externally funded research projects focused on how primates and other mammals evolved following the extinction of the dinosaurs. They encourage undergraduates to contact them regarding funded research opportunities in the Mammalian Evolutionary Morphology Laboratory.

The acidity of Antarctica's coastal waters could double by the end of the century, threatening whales, penguins and hundreds of other species that inhabit the Southern Ocean, according to new research from the Univeristy of Colorado Boulder.

Scientists projected that by 2100, the upper 650 feet (200 meters) of the ocean -- where much marine life resides -- could see more than a 100% increase in acidity compared with 1990s levels. The paper, appeared Jan. 4 in the journal Nature Communications.
""The findings are critical for our understanding of the future evolution of marine ecosystem health,"" said Nicole Lovenduski, the paper's co-author and the interim director of CU Boulder's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR).
The oceans play an important role as a buffer against climate change by absorbing nearly 30% of the CO2 emitted worldwide. But as more CO2 dissolves in the oceans, the seawater becomes more acidic. ""Human-caused CO2 emissions are at the heart of ocean acidification,"" said Cara Nissen, the paper's first author and a research scientist at INSTAAR.
The Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica, is particularly susceptible to acidification, partly because colder water tends to absorb more CO2. Ocean currents in the area also contribute to the relatively acidic water conditions.
Using a computer model, Nissen, Lovenduski and the team simulated how the seawater of the Southern Ocean would change in the 21st century. They found it would become more acidic by 2100, and the situation would be severe if the world fails to cut emissions.
""It's not just the top layer of the ocean. The entire water column of the coastal Southern Ocean, even at the bottom, could experience severe acidification,"" Nissen said.

The team then investigated the conditions specifically in Antarctica's marine protected areas (MPAs). Human activities, such as fishing, are restricted in these regions to protect biodiversity. Currently, there are two MPAs in the Southern Ocean, covering about 12% of water in the region. Scientists have proposed designating three more MPAs to an international council in the past years, which would encompass about 60% of the Antarctic Ocean.
The team's model showed that both adopted and proposed MPAs would experience significant acidification by the end of the century.
For example, under the highest-emission scenario, where the world makes no efforts to cut emissions, the average acidity of the water in the Ross Sea region -- the world's largest MPA off the northern tip of Antarctica -- would increase by 104% over 1990s levels by 2100. Under an intermediate emissions scenario, the water would still become 43% more acidic.
""It's surprising to me how severe ocean acidification would be in these coastal waters,"" Nissen said.
Previous studies have shown that phytoplankton, a group of algae that forms the basis of the marine food web, grow at a slower rate or die out when the water becomes too acidic. Acidic water also weakens the shells of organisms like sea snails and sea urchins. These changes could disrupt the food web, eventually impacting top predators like whales and penguins.
The Weddell Sea is one of the three proposed MPAs located off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Nissen said scientists think the Weddell Sea region could act as a climate change sanctuary for organisms, mainly because this area has the highest levels of sea ice coverage in the Antarctic. The ice shields the ocean from warming and prevents the seawater underneath from absorbing CO2 from the air, thereby reducing the rate of acidification. In addition, the region has little human activity to date.

But the model suggested that as the planet continues to warm, the sea ice will melt, and the Weddell Sea region will experience acidification on par with other MPAs under intermediate to high emission scenarios, but with a slightly delayed progression.
""The result shows that establishing the Weddell Sea region as a protected area should have high priority,"" Nissen said.
""As a scientist who typically studies the open ocean, I tend to think of Antarctic coastal areas as a conduit for climate signals to reach the global, deep ocean. This study reminded me that these dynamic Antarctic coastal areas are also themselves capable of rapid change,"" Lovenduski said.
The study suggests that the world could only avoid severe ocean acidification of the Southern Ocean under the lowest emission scenario, where society cuts CO2 emissions quickly and aggressively.
""We still have time to select our emission pathway, but we don't have much,"" Nissen said.

Despite being threatened by anthropogenic climate change, uncertainties remain surrounding the future ocean acidification (OA) of these waters. Here we present 21st-century projections of OA in Antarctic MPAs under four emission scenarios using a high-resolution ocean–sea ice–biogeochemistry model with realistic ice-shelf geometry. By 2100, we project pH declines of up to 0.36 (total scale) for the top 200 m. Vigorous vertical mixing of anthropogenic carbon produces severe OA throughout the water column in coastal waters of proposed and existing MPAs. Consequently, end-of-century aragonite undersaturation is ubiquitous under the three highest emission scenarios. Given the cumulative threat to marine ecosystems by environmental change and activities such as fishing, our findings call for strong emission-mitigation efforts and further management strategies to reduce pressures on ecosystems, such as the continuation and expansion of Antarctic MPAs."

Psilocybe fungi, known colloquially as ""magic mushrooms,"" have held deep significance in Indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica for centuries. They captured the wider world's attention as a psychedelic staple in the 60s and 70s. Now, these infamous organisms are at the forefront of a mental health revolution. Psilocybin and psilocin, the psychoactive compounds found in nearly all species of Psilocybe, have shown promise as a treatment for conditions including PTSD, depression, and for easing end-of-life care.

To utilize psilocybin as a therapeutic, scientists need an extensive roadmap of the compound's underlying genetics and evolution, information that doesn't exist. Our limited knowledge comes from research on just a fraction of the ~165 known species of Psilocybe. Most psilocybin-producing mushrooms haven't been studied since they were first discovered -- until now.
A team of researchers led by the University of Utah and the Natural History Museum of Utah (NHMU) has completed the largest genomic diversity study for the genus Psilocybe. Their genomic analysis of 52 Psilocybe specimens includes 39 species that have never been sequenced.
The authors found that Psilocybe arose much earlier than previously thought -- about 65 million years ago, right around when the dinosaur-killing asteroid caused a mass extinction event. They established that psilocybin was first synthesized in mushrooms in the genus Psilocybe, with four to five possible horizontal gene transfers to other mushrooms from 40 up to 9 million years ago.
Their analysis revealed two distinct gene orders within the gene cluster that produces psilocybin. The two gene patterns correspond to an ancient split in the genus, suggesting two independent acquisitions of psilocybin in itsevolutionary history. The study is the first to reveal such a strong evolutionary pattern within the gene sequences underpinning the psychoactive proteins synthesis.
""If psilocybin does turn out to be this kind of wonder drug, there's going to be a need to develop therapeutics to improve its efficacy. What if it already exists in nature?"" said Bryn Dentinger, curator of mycology at NHMU and senior author of the study. ""There's a wealth of diversity of these compounds out there. To understand where they are and how they're made, we need to do this kind of molecular work to use biodiversity to our advantage.""
All the study's Psilocybe DNA came from specimens in museum collections around the world. Twenty-three of the 52 specimens were ""type specimens,"" the gold standard designating a species against which all other samples are measured. For example, say you identify a wild mushroom as a certain species of chanterelle -- you're betting that the mushroom you picked is the same as the physical material sitting in a box in a museum. The authors' molecular work on type species is a major contribution to mycology because it establishes an authoritative foundation for all future work on Psilocybe diversity in taxonomy.

""These type specimens represent hundreds of years of thousands of scientists' collective effort to document diversity, way before people were thinking about DNA,"" said Alexander Bradshaw, postdoctoral researcher at the U and lead author of the study. ""That's the beauty of it -- no one has really sequenced type specimens at this scale, and now we get to produce molecular and genomic data to the gold standard of Psilocybe types for people to compare against.""
The study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Jan. 9, 2024.
A trip through time
Previous studies identified the cluster of four core genes that produce psilocybin based on genomic analysis of threePsilocybe species. The species were closely related to each other, and all had matching gene patterns within the psilocybin-producing gene clusters. This study's expanded genomics of 52 specimens of Psilocybe revealed a second distinct pattern.
""This work represents a big step in the understanding of the evolutionary relationships in Psilocybe because it is the first to include a broad species sampling and is based on type specimens,"" said Virginia Ramírez-Cruz, mycologist at the Universidad de Guadalajara and co-lead author of the study.
The authors found that 17 specimens had the original order, while 35 exhibited the new pattern.

""We've shown here that there's been a lot of change in gene order over time, and that provides some new tools for biotechnology. If you're looking for a way to express the genes to produce the psilocybin and related compounds, you no longer have to rely on only one set of gene sequences to do that. Now there's tremendous diversity that scientists can look at for lots of different properties or efficiencies,"" said Dentinger, who is also an associate professor of biology at the University of Utah.
Dating of the group showed that an ancient split of the two gene cluster patterns occurred around 57 million years ago, which also corresponded to a shift in the ecology. The first psilocybin-producing mushrooms likely arose as a wood-decomposing group, then transitioned to soil after the split, with some species such as Psilocybe cubensis transiting to growing on herbivore dung. The ecological shift to dung appears to have occurred at least twice independently in their evolutionary history.
What does psilocybin do for mushrooms?
The authors hoped that psilocybin's evolutionary history would clarify the most basic question -- what does psilocybin do for mushrooms? The psilocybin-producing gene clusters likely have some benefit, but no one knows what it is.
The molecular structure of psilocybin mimics serotonin and binds tightly to serotonin receptors, especially at 5-HT2A, a famous receptor onto which many psychedelic drugs bind. When a chemical binds to these receptors in mammals and similar ones in insects and arachnids, they produce unnatural and altered behaviors. Some have proposed that this altered mental state might be a direct deterrent to predation. It's also possible that psilocybin functions as a laxative or induces vomiting to spread spores before they are fully digested. However, psilocybin mushrooms often occur infrequently in the wild, making it unlikely that animals could learn to recognize them. An alternative theory is that psilocybin is a chemical defense against insects. However, empirical studies are lacking, and the authors' personal observations confirm that psilocybin-containing mushrooms regularly host healthy, thriving insect larvae.
The authors are preparing experiments to test an alternative theory that they call the Gastropod Hypothesis. The timing and divergence dates of Psilocybe coincide with the KPg boundary, the geological marker of the asteroid that threw Earth into a brutal, prolonged winter and killed 80% of all life. Two lifeforms that thrived during the darkness and decay were fungi and terrestrial gastropods. Evidence, including the fossil record, shows that gastropods had a massive diversification and proliferation just after the asteroid hit, and it's known that terrestrial slugs are heavy predators of mushrooms. With the study's molecular dating of Psilocybe to around 65 million years ago, it's possible that psilocybin evolved as a slug deterrent. They hope that their feeding experiments will shed some light on their hypothesis.
In 2020, the authors set a goal to get a genome sequence for every Psilocybe type specimen. To date, they've generated genomes of 71 type specimens and continue to collaborate with collections around the world.
""It's impossible to overstate the importance of collections for doing studies like this. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, who spent thousands of people-power hours to create these collections, so that I can write an email and request access to rare specimens, many of which have only ever been collected once, and may never be collected again,"" said Bradshaw.

In the fascinating world of plant biology, an innovative study recently featured on the cover of The Plant Journal has been turning heads. The research delves into the intricate defense mechanisms of tomatoes against the notorious bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst). It's a classic tale of nature's arms race: as pathogens evolve to outsmart plant defenses, plants counter with more sophisticated immune responses.

The study is based on research conducted by scientists in Dr. Greg Martin's lab at the Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI). Central to the study are proteins called Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), the plant equivalent of immune system warriors. They recognize and respond to pathogen attacks, triggering a series of defense mechanisms. Among these are the helper NLRs, Nrc2 and Nrc3, which work in concert with the tomato NLR Prf and its partner kinase, Pto, in a well-orchestrated defense against Pst.
The groundbreaking aspect of this research lies in its exploration of the roles of Nrc2 and Nrc3. Using CRISPR technology, the scientists created tomato mutant plants lacking these NLRs. While these mutants appeared normal under typical conditions, they exhibited increased susceptibility to Pst, similar to plants lacking the Prf protein. ""This finding was pivotal, highlighting the indispensable role of Nrc2 and Nrc3 in the tomato immune response,"" noted Dr. Ning Zhang, a post-doctoral researcher at BTI and first author of the study.
One of the most intriguing outcomes of the research is understanding how Nrc2 and Nrc3 fit into the overall defense system. They seem to act upstream in the signaling cascade that leads to programmed cell death -- a critical component of the plant's immune response. This places them as essential intermediaries of the complex network of plant immunity.
The attention to Zhang's research is a validation of its significance. ""I'm thrilled that our discoveries on the workings of helper NLRs received prominent coverage in The Plant Journal,"" she remarked. ""Our work sheds light on how plants defend themselves -- a topic of immense importance in agriculture.""
In essence, the research by Zhang and colleagues isn't just a story of scientific discovery; it's a roadmap for future innovations in crop resilience. ""By unraveling the roles of helper NLRs like Nrc2 and Nrc3, we are a step closer to developing crops that can better withstand the challenges posed by pathogens, helping ensure food security and agricultural sustainability,"" said Zhang.

Recently, ‘sensor’ NLRs have been reported to function with ‘helper’ NLRs to activate immunity. We investigated the role of two helper NLRs, Nrc2 and Nrc3, on immunity in tomato to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) mediated by the sensor NLR Prf and the Pto kinase. An nrc2/nrc3 mutant no longer activated Prf/Pto‐mediated NTI to Pst containing the effectors AvrPto and AvrPtoB. An nrc3 mutant showed intermediate susceptibility between wild‐type plants and a Prf mutant, while an nrc2 mutant developed only mild disease. These observations indicate that Nrc2 and Nrc3 act additively in Prf‐/Pto‐mediated immunity. We examined at what point Nrc2 and Nrc3 act in the Prf/Pto‐mediated immune response. In the nrc2/3 mutant, programmed cell death (PCD) normally induced by constitutively active variants of AvrPtoB, Pto, or Prf was abolished, but that induced by M3Kα or Mkk2 was not. PCD induced by a constitutively active Nrc3 was also abolished in a Nicotiana benthamiana line with reduced expression of Prf. MAPK activation triggered by expression of AvrPto in the wild‐type tomato plants was completely abolished in the nrc2/3 mutant. These results indicate that Nrc2 and Nrc3 act with Prf/Pto and upstream of MAPK signaling. Nrc2 and Nrc3 were not required for PCD triggered by Ptr1, another sensor NLR‐mediating Pst resistance, although these helper NLRs do appear to be involved in resistance to certain Pst race 1 strains"

As the potter works the spinning wheel, the friction between their hands and the soft clay helps them shape it into all kinds of forms and creations. In a fascinating parallel, sea squirt oocytes (immature egg cells) harness friction within various compartments in their interior to undergo developmental changes after conception. A study from the Heisenberg group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), published in Nature Physics, now describes how this works.

The sea is full of fascinating life forms. From algae and colorful fish to marine snails and sea squirts, a completely different world reveals itself underwater. Sea squirts or ascidians in particular are very unusual: after a free-moving larvae stage, the larva settles down, attaches to solid surfaces like rocks or corals, and develops tubes (siphons), their defining feature. Although they look like rubbery blobs as adults, they are the most closely related invertebrate relatives to humans. Especially at the larval stages, sea squirts are surprisingly similar to us.
Therefore, ascidians are often used as model organisms to study the early embryonic development of vertebrates to which humans belong. ""While ascidians exhibit the basic developmental and morphological features of vertebrates, they also have the cellular and genomic simplicity typical of invertebrates,"" explains Carl-Philipp Heisenberg, Professor at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA). ""Especially the ascidian larva is an ideal model for understanding early vertebrate development.""
His research group's latest work, published in Nature Physics, now gives new insights into their development. The findings suggest that upon fertilization of ascidian oocytes, friction forces play a crucial role in reshaping and reorganizing their insides, heralding the next steps in their developmental cascade.
Decoding oocyte transformation
Oocytes are female germ cells involved in reproduction. After successful fertilization with male sperm, animal oocytes typically undergo cytoplasmic reorganization, altering their cellular contents and components. This process establishes the blueprint for the embryo's subsequent development. In ascidians, for instance, this reshuffling leads to the formation of a bell-like protrusion -- a little bump or nose shape -- known as the contraction pole (CP), where essential materials gather that facilitate the embryo's maturation. The underlying mechanism driving this process, however, has been unknown.
A group of scientists from ISTA, Université de Paris Cité, CNRS, King's College London, and Sorbonne Université set out to decipher that mystery. For this endeavor, the Heisenberg group imported adult ascidians from the Roscoff Marine Station in France. Almost all sea squirts are hermaphrodites, as they produce both male and female germ cells. ""In the lab, we keep them in saltwater tanks in a species-appropriate manner to obtain eggs and sperm for studying their early embryonic development,"" says Silvia Caballero-Mancebo, the first author of this study and previous PhD student in the Heisenberg lab.

The scientists microscopically analyzed fertilized ascidian oocytes and realized that they were following very reproducible changes in cell shape leading up to the formation of the contraction pole. The researchers' first investigation focused on the actomyosin (cell) cortex -- a dynamic structure found beneath the cell membrane in animal cells. Composed of actin filaments and motor proteins, it generally acts as a driver for shape changes in cells.
""We uncovered that when cells are fertilized, increased tension in the actomyosin cortex causes it to contract, leading to its movement (flow), resulting in the initial changes of the cell's shape,"" Caballero-Mancebo continues. The actomyosin flows, however, stopped during the expansion of the contraction pole, suggesting that there are additional players responsible for the bump.
Friction forces impact cell reshaping
The scientists took a closer look at other cellular components that might play a role in the expansion of the contraction pole. In doing so, they came across the myoplasm, a layer composed of intracellular organelles and molecules (related forms of which are found in many vertebrate and invertebrate eggs), positioned in the lower region of the ascidian egg cell. ""This specific layer behaves like a stretchy solid -- it changes its shape along with the oocyte during fertilization,"" Caballero-Mancebo explains.
During the actomyosin cortex flow, the myoplasm folds and forms many buckles due to the friction forces established between the two components. As actomyosin movement stops, the friction forces also disappear. ""This cessation eventually leads to the expansion of the contraction pole as the multiple myoplasm buckles resolve into the well-defined bell-like-shaped bump,"" Caballero-Mancebo adds.
The study provides novel insight into how mechanical forces determine cell and organismal shape. It shows that friction forces are pivotal for shaping and forming an evolving organism. However, scientists are only at the beginning of understanding the specific role of friction in embryonic development. Heisenberg adds: ""The myoplasm is also very intriguing, as it is involved in other embryonic processes of ascidians as well. Exploring its unusual material properties and grasping how they play a role in shaping sea squirts, will be highly interesting.""

However, how these cortical flows interact with adjacent cytoplasmic components, changing their form and localization, and how this affects cytoplasmic organization and cell shape remains unclear. Here we show that in ascidian oocytes, the cooperative activities of cortical actomyosin flows and deformation of the adjacent mitochondria-rich myoplasm drive oocyte cytoplasmic reorganization and shape changes following fertilization. We show that vegetal-directed cortical actomyosin flows, established upon oocyte fertilization, lead to both the accumulation of cortical actin at the vegetal pole of the zygote and compression and local buckling of the adjacent elastic solid-like myoplasm layer due to friction forces generated at their interface. Once cortical flows have ceased, the multiple myoplasm buckles resolve into one larger buckle, which again drives the formation of the contraction pole—a protuberance of the zygote’s vegetal pole where maternal mRNAs accumulate. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism where cortical actomyosin network flows determine cytoplasmic reorganization and cell shape by deforming adjacent cytoplasmic components through friction forces."

It may sound strange, but we can actually learn more about ourselves by studying pigs.

Pigs and humans are pretty similar. Our organs, our skin and the way many diseases develop are largely the same.
Pigs have therefore long been used to develop and test new medicines, even though pigs are larger, more expensive and more difficult to use in experiments than rats and mice.
And now pigs may become even more valuable as laboratory animals, because researchers from the Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics at Aarhus University have mapped the most important genetic similarities between pigs and humans.
The researchers have not only identified the genes that are the same in humans and pigs; they have also identified the so-called 'transcriptome' across a number of tissue types. Where the genome includes all the genes found in the DNA of our cells, whether active or inactive, the transcriptome includes the genes that are active in the different types of cells in our body, says Lingzhao Fang, one of the main researchers behind the new findings.
""We examined which genes are active and how they are regulated in 34 different types of tissue in pigs, and compared this with similar studies in humans. We looked at everything from testicular tissue to skin cells and various brain cells,"" he says and continues:
""No one has ever conducted a study at this scale and comprehensiveness, and we hope the new knowledge can make a difference in agriculture as well as in the pharmaceutical industry.""
More useful knowledge from RNA

A little more than 20 years ago, a group of more than 1,000 researchers succeeded in mapping the entire human genome. After completing the project, the researchers hoped they could now develop treatments for nearly all diseases, because they now knew the code and could identify the errors.
But that is not how the story went.
The researchers soon discovered that there is a big difference between the genes in an individual's recipe book and the recipes that are actually used and translated in the various cell types.
This is what is also referred to as genotype and phenotype, with phenotype referring to the traits or symptoms that can be observed in an individual. Because of the greater role played by the transcriptome, a person can have the genetic disposition for a disease without actually suffering from the disease.
In other words, two people who, on paper, have the same disease mutation do not necessarily become ill to the same extent. With greater knowledge about the role of the transcriptome in various diseases, it is possible to develop better and more targeted medicines.
And this is one area in which the results from Lingzhao Fang's study can be useful when it comes to pigs as laboratory animals.

""Pigs become more suited as animals for testing new medicines. As the various tissue types in pigs and humans are very similar, in fact more similar than we thought, the pharmaceutical industry can test the safety of new medicines in pigs with much higher accuracy,"" he says.
Can also help agriculture become greener
The pharmaceutical industry is not the only industry to potentially benefit from the new results. Agriculture can also use the results in their efforts to breed pigs with a reduced climate impact, according to Lingzhao Fang.
""There's never before been such a comprehensive mapping of the genes that are active in various tissue types. Our results make it possible to more precisely pinpoint the genetic mechanisms that lead to different desirable traits in pigs,"" he says and continues:
""For example, traits that make them more climate-friendly. Our mapping also paves the way for researchers to edit pig genes far more precisely and in this way develop entirely new properties in the future. Because we now know more about a wide range of traits in pigs, other researchers can more easily use gene-editing techniques such as CRISPR to change genes or insert new sequences with greener properties.""
Mapping other animals as well
Pigs are actually not the first animal whose transcriptome Lingzhao Fang and his colleagues have mapped. They started with cows a few years ago, and they plan to map a number of other animals in the coming years.
""We already have a study on chickens in the pipeline. It's currently being peer-reviewed, but we hope to publish it early next year,"" he says.
In addition to chickens, pigs and cows, the research team is studying goats, sheep, horses and ducks using the same method. He explains that the ultimate objective is not only to make agriculture greener but also to obtain a better understanding of fundamental animal and human biology.
""Once we've completed the project, we'll have gained a greater basic understanding of the biology and evolution of a number of animals. This knowledge can be useful in other areas,"" he says and continues:
""For example, we have problems with disease transmission between humans and farm animals. Our mapping may provide us with the necessary knowledge to limit and prevent outbreaks in the future.
One of the reasons why Lingzhao Fang is studying farm animals and not wild animals is that it is easy to access tissue samples and large amounts of data. However, the knowledge obtained can also be used in relation to wild and even extinct animals.
""We will gain a fundamental understanding of the biology of several different animals, and these all have wild cousins who basically function in the same way,"" he concludes.
DNA, RNA and transcriptomes
In the centre of every human and pig cell, inside a small nucleus, are the long, two-stranded DNA molecules that make up the chromosomes. The strands consist of almost endless rows of four small molecules that we abbreviate to A, C, G and T.
The sequence of the four molecules is what forms our genes. A gene is a sequence of the four molecules and it serves as a recipe for a protein.
However, before the cell can produce one of the many different proteins for which it has recipes in its DNA, the sequence must be translated. This happens when the two strands of DNA unwind where the recipe is located and a so-called RNA strand binds to this place and copies the part of the code that makes up the gene. In simple terms, RNA is single-stranded DNA.
RNA leaves the cell nucleus and transports the code to the cell's protein factories, the ribosomes, where the code is then translated into a protein.
All cells in our body have the same DNA, but the parts of the DNA code that are translated and activated differ from cell to cell. Liver cells have other active genes than skin cells, for example. Not all RNA sequences transport code to the protein factories. Instead, some bits attach themselves to other RNA sequences to stop them from being translated into proteins, or to ensure that the body produces even more of the protein in question.
The RNA sequences that are active in a specific type of cell are called the transcriptome. This is what the researchers have been studying in this research project.

From a wartime spread of antimicrobial resistant disease in Ukraine, to superbugs in China causing ""white lung"" pneumonia in children, 2023 brought no shortage of new evidence that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to be a pressing problem globally, and this pattern shows no sign of abating in 2024 unless a radical shift occurs.

To truly tackle the issue of AMR, York University researchers with the Global Strategy Lab (GSL) argue it needs to be understood as a socio-ecological challenge that accepts AMR as a phenomenon stemming from natural evolutionary processes. In other words, the war on bugs can't be won; what's needed is a major change in how people live with it.
""For the past hundred years, we've tried to address AMR like a medical problem. But we haven't really made much progress in actually mitigating the deeper drivers of the issue,"" says Isaac Weldon, a recent York PhD political science graduate and lead author of a new peer-reviewed article published today in the journal Perspectives on Politics journal. ""We argue that there's a lot of potential to make progress by instead looking at it as a problem with our relationship with the microbial world and sustainability.""
AMR stems from both the natural tendency of bacteria, viruses and fungi to evolve as well as the acceleration of that process through human interventions such as an over-reliance or misuse of antibiotics in medical settings, to the routine use of antimicrobials in the livestock industry. Global data from 2019 showed more than a million deaths a year directly related to AMR, and the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have accelerated this process.
Last year, GSL set up the AMR Policy Accelerator with $8.7 million from Wellcome Trust to deal with this urgent threat. While Weldon acknowledges that medical and technological innovation will be a crucial component in managing the issue, new antimicrobial drugs alone will not be the solution.
""What we're currently doing is treating the symptoms and not the causes of AMR,"" says Weldon, also an investigator with GSL. ""Without addressing the underlying social relationships that drive our use, innovation would have to operate at an unsustainable speed as these microbes evolve faster than we can make new drugs.""
Weldon and co-author Steven J. Hoffman, director of GSL and Dahdaleh Distinguished Chair in Global Governance & Legal Epidemiology with York's Faculty of Health and Osgoode Hall Law School, outline major problems with the current governance approach to AMR. They introduce five principles for designing institutions for a better ecological fit of human-microbial ecosystems to minimize drug resistance: There's no silver bullet. Recognizing that there is no easy fit or one-fits all solution for AMR means problem-solving must always be tailored to specific ecological situations and health challenges of diverse populations. Create institutions that can adapt over time. Future proofing doesn't mean creating institutions that are strong enough to withstand change, but ones flexible enough to evolve with the changing nature of AMR and our relationship to it. Diversify practices. As the best way to tackle AMR is still unknown, diversifying practices can help us discover what works, when, and where. Create records. As practices are diversified, records need to be kept of what works to enable learning and adjustments in policy. Involve stakeholders. This involves everyone from the public at large, to government and decision makers.""What we are proposing is a completely different way of looking at the issue,"" says Hoffman. ""We are hoping this journal article will be a foundational piece that will inspire further AMR research in this direction.""

This microscopic evolution is further propelled by human activities, where each use of an antimicrobial drug potentially induces AMR. As microbes can spread quickly from animals to humans and travel around the world through humanity’s global circuits of movement, the use of any antimicrobial drug has potentially global consequences. As human-induced AMR occurs, mortality and morbidity increase due to increasingly or sometimes completely ineffective antimicrobial treatments. This article considers AMR as a product of the evolving and complex interplay between human societies and invisible microbial worlds. It argues that as a political challenge, AMR requires robust institutions that can manage human–microbial interactions to minimize the emergence of drug resistance and maximize the likelihood of achieving effective antimicrobial use for all. Yet, current governance systems for AMR are ill-equipped to meet these goals. We propose a conceptual paradigm shift for global AMR governance efforts, arguing that global governance could better address AMR if approached as a socioecological problem in need of sustainable management rather than solely as a medical problem to be solved. In biodiversity governance, institutions are designed to fit the biological features of the ecosystems that they are attempting to manage. We consider how a similar approach can improve global AMR governance. Employing the concept of ecological fit, which is defined as the alignment between human social systems and biological ecosystems, we diagnose 18 discrepancies between the social institutions that currently govern AMR and the ecological nature of this problem. Drawing from lessons learned in biodiversity governance, the article proposes five institutional design principles for improving the fit and effectiveness of global AMR governance."

Badminton traces its roots back more than a millennium, but the modern version of the racket game originated in the late 19th century in England. Today, it is the second most popular sport in the world behind soccer, with an estimated 220 million people who enjoy playing. For the last three decades, badminton has been a competitive Olympic sport, and with ""bird"" speeds topping 300 mph in ""smash"" shots, it certainly makes for exciting spectator sport.

Shuttlecocks, also known as birdies or birds, are traditionally made from duck feathers, but nylon shuttlecocks have become more widely used because of their superior durability. Their flight behavior, however, is far different from that of traditional feather birdies.
In Physics of Fluids, by AIP Publishing, a trio of scientists in India explored the aerodynamic performance of nylon shuttlecocks at various flight speeds. Through computational analyses based on two-way fluid-structure interactions, the team coupled equations governing air flow with equations determining skirt deformation of a shuttlecock in flight.
""We studied the flow by examining aerodynamic forces on the shuttlecock as well as its deformations at each flight speed,"" said author Sanjay Mittal. ""The pressure on the skirt causes it to deform inwards and this deformation increases with speed.""
The team identified four distinct regimes of deformation. At speeds less than 40 meters per second (89 mph), the skirt maintains circularity despite cross-sectional deformation; at higher speeds, it buckles and deforms into a square before it then vibrates radially. Eventually, it undergoes a low frequency wavelike circumferential deformation.
""The cross-sectional area of the shuttlecock decreases with speed, which lowers the air flow rate through the shuttlecock,"" said Mittal. ""The vortex structures that form inside the shuttlecock weaken when it deforms. As a result of these effects, the deformed shuttlecock offers a much lower air resistance compared to its rigid counterpart.""
The study's computational results confirm experimental measurements, explaining the phenomenology of why a duck feather shuttlecock does not deform as much as a nylon shuttlecock -- and why the flight of each at high speed is quite different. From the perspective of a player on the receiving end of a smash shot, the nylon shuttlecock, which travels faster, is harder to return.
Ultimately, the research may represent a new arc in the history of the beloved sport.
""Our study opens up the possibility for improved designs that make the nylon shuttlecock structurally stiffer so that it more closely mimics the aerodynamic performance of feather shuttlecocks,"" said Mittal. ""This could be a game-changer, literally.""

The cork of the shuttlecock is held fixed and its skirt is free to deform. The cross-sectional area of the skirt decreases with an increase in flight speed leading to a significant reduction in the drag compared to that for an undeformed shuttlecock. Four regimes of deformation, with an increase in speed, are identified. The deformation is steady and axisymmetric in regime 1. Beyond a certain speed, which is referred to as “buckling speed,” the deformation is in regime 2. The skirt assumes a non-axisymmetric shape with a significant increase in its rate of deformation with speed. It undergoes vibration in regime 3. The amplitude of vibration increases with increased speed. In regime 4, the vibrations are modulated atop a lower frequency wave that travels circumferentially along the skirt. Compared to a rigid shuttlecock at the same flow speed, the streamwise vortex structures inside the skirt are weaker in a deformed shuttlecock. The decrease in the drag coefficient with an increase in speed is due to a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the skirt as well as a reduction in the entrainment of the flow through the gaps in the skirt area. The computational results are in good agreement with the available experimental measurements. The effect of the elastic modulus of the material and various structural reinforcements is studied."

Butterfly populations in Catalonia in northern Spain are better than their UK counterparts at regulating their body temperature by basking in the sunshine, but rising global temperatures due to climate change may put Spanish butterflies at greater risk of extinction.

An international study, led by the University of Cambridge and the Institut de Biologia Evolutiva (IBE) in Barcelona, found that butterflies use different methods to regulate their body temperature. In Catalonia, butterflies tend to angle their wings towards the sun to warm up at lower temperatures, while British butterflies rely more on finding warm microclimates.
However, as temperatures rise, both populations switch to heat-avoiding behaviour. As global temperatures rise, British butterflies may initially benefit, while Spanish butterflies may not be able to survive if they are not able to adapt quickly enough.
However, habitat loss, particularly in the UK, is an equally important threat to butterflies. Diverse habitats offer butterflies a greater variety of microclimates, and initiatives such as 'no-mow May', allowing wildflowers to grow along roadsides, and planting more trees can help counter habitat loss. The results are reported in the Journal of Animal Ecology.
Like all insects, butterflies are 'cold-blooded' and use their environment to regulate their internal temperature. Understanding how butterflies thermoregulate is important for predicting which species are most at risk from the effects of climate change.
In a study published in 2020, several of the same researchers showed that there are significant variations in the ability of different UK butterfly species to maintain a suitable body temperature. Species that rely mostly on shade to keep cool are at greatest risk of population decline, due to climate change and habitat loss.
""The first study in the UK showed that butterflies are pretty good at regulating their body temperature in this cooler climate, but we wanted to see whether butterflies in a warmer climate, such as Spain, are doing anything differently,"" said lead author Eric Toro-Delgado from IBE, a joint centre of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) and Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), ""And if there are differences, what mechanisms might be driving it?""
""In Spain, butterflies spend much more time at their optimum temperature since it's warmer, but there's also a greater risk of overheating,"" said Dr Andrew Bladon from Cambridge's Department of Zoology, the study's senior author. ""We wanted to see whether the results we got from our UK data would be repeatable in a different environment.""

For the current study, the researchers collected similar data as the 2020 UK paper, but from butterflies in Catalonia. They measured body temperature, air temperature, and perch temperature for almost 800 adult butterflies from 23 different species: for ten of these species, the researchers had comparable data from the UK.
""We hypothesised that Spanish butterflies might show adaptations to their warmer climate, which could give us an indication of how British butterflies might need to adapt to cope with climate change,"" said Bladon.
The researchers found that on a community level, butterflies in Catalonia were better at regulating, or buffering, their body temperature than British butterflies. Butterflies in both countries switch from heat-seeking to heat-avoiding behaviour once air temperatures reach approximately 22°C. However, the communities differ in the use of buffering mechanisms, with British populations depending more on microclimates for thermoregulation compared to Catalan populations.
Many landscapes in the UK do not provide a sufficient diversity of thermal environments, with alternating areas of shade and sun. For UK butterflies that rely on microclimates to regulate body temperature, habitat and biodiversity loss is a major threat. In Catalonia, one of the reasons why butterflies are better at regulating their temperature could be because butterflies have many more thermal options available to them.
""In the UK, many of our nature reserves are like islands, with little variety in between,"" said Bladon. ""If we can provide them with field margins, biodiverse road verges, more wildflowers, and longer grass, butterflies can more easily move through the landscape, helping them find their preferred temperatures so they can thrive.""
Although Catalan butterfly populations seem to be able to thermoregulate successfully at present, rising global temperatures due to climate change put them at greater risk, since it is so warm in Spain already.

""In the UK study, the Cambridge team found that wing size was related to the ability of a species to regulate its body temperature, and that species with large wings were better at it,"" said Toro-Delgado. ""We expected to find a similar result in Spain, but we didn't. This is likely because in a warm country like Spain, the ability to avoid heat is preferable, and wings may play a less relevant role in this than in warming up.""
""Because of rising global temperatures, the UK's climate is becoming a little bit more like Spain, so climate change may benefit British butterflies in the short term,"" said Bladon. ""But what's striking is butterflies in both countries showed signs of heat avoidance. And the Catalan butterflies are at greater risk since they are already near their thermal optimum.""
The researchers say that beyond rising temperatures, butterflies are also at risk from associated climate impacts, such as droughts or heatwaves. These extreme weather events can not only push butterflies past their thermal limits, but it can kill the plants which their caterpillars rely on.
""Climate change is a two-pronged attack that can take out both adult butterflies and their caterpillars,"" said Toro-Delgado. ""Climate change and biodiversity loss go hand-in-hand, and we urgently need to address both if we're going to protect important species like butterflies.""
The research was supported in part by the Spanish National Research Council, the Isaac Newton Trust, Wellcome, Generalitat de Catalunya, the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, the UK Natural Environment Research Council, and the European Social Fund Plus.

However, the communities differ in the use of buffering mechanisms, with British populations depending more on microclimates for thermoregulation compared to Catalan populations.

Finally, we tested whether thermoregulatory ability could explain species' demographic trends in Catalonia. The sampled sites in each region differ climatically, with higher temperatures and solar radiation but lower wind speeds in the Catalan sites. Both butterfly communities show nonlinear responses to temperature, suggesting a change in behaviour from heat‐seeking to heat avoidance at approximately 22°C. However, the communities differ in the use of buffering mechanisms, with British populations depending more on microclimates for thermoregulation compared to Catalan populations. Contrary to the results from British populations, we did not find a relationship between region‐wide demographic trends and butterfly thermoregulation, which may be due to the interplay between thermoregulation and the habitat changes occurring in each region. Thus, although Catalan butterfly populations seem to be able to thermoregulate successfully at present, evidence of heat avoidance suggests this situation may change in the future."

Africa has a huge diversity of large mammals, but their evolutionary relationships and movement across the continent over time often remain a mystery. A new scientific study sheds light on longstanding questions about the interplay between evolution and geography in one of these mammals, namely the iconic African bushpig, and helps settle a major question regarding prehistoric human activities shaping biodiversity patterns in Africa.

In the ongoing biodiversity crisis, large terrestrial animals are more threatened by extinction than any other group of organisms. The African continent holds an impressively intact large-mammal community, but there is still a lot we do not know about how these species evolved, became diverse and adapted to the changing climate and habitats. Many of these questions can be addressed by investigating the genomes and genetic variation across species.
New research, published in Nature Communications, uses genomics to answer these evolutionary questions that have been debated amongst scientists for decades: 1) how and when did bushpigs cross the Mozambique Channel and arrive at the island of Madagascar, 2) is there one or two species of bushpigs?
""This study is a result of a large international collaboration with researchers from Africa and Europe. We sequenced 67 complete bushpig genomes and by using a range of different genetic analyses, we were able to address these long-standing puzzles in African evolution and biogeography,"" explains one of the senior authors of the study, Associate Professor at the Department of Biology, Rasmus Heller.
Were pigs ferried across the channel during the Medieval era?
The island of Madagascar separated from the African mainland around 160 million years ago, resulting in a largely unique flora and fauna. Remarkably, the bushpig is the only large, wild terrestrial mammal species that has somehow historically crossed the 400-kilometer-wide Mozambique Channel and made it from mainland Africa to the island of Madagascar.
""Our study establishes that the bushpig was introduced to Madagascar ≈1,000-5,000 years ago from South/South-East Africa,"" Rasmus states. Their arrival therefore coincides with the arrival of humans to Madagascar from a region around southern Africa. Rasmus continues: ""The likely explanation for this is that people transported these bushpigs across the channel. These results contradict previously published studies which dated the arrival of bushpigs ≈480,000 years ago, well before humans were present on the island."" It has been suggested that some endemic Madagascar species might have arrived by rafting as passengers on floats of vegetation.

""Intriguingly, our results raise a host of new questions: was the bushpig actually brought to Madagascar as a somewhat domesticated species? There is no archaeological or other evidence of bushpig domestication ever occurring, despite them being an important source of protein for many rural communities. And who was it that transported these animals to Madagascar? Was it Bantu-speakers, Austronesian-speakers or both? These questions and others still remain to be explored,"" explains Renzo F. Balboa, postdoc at the Department of Biology and one of the leading authors of the study.
Does two actually equal one?
African bushpigs, which primarily are found in East/Southern Africa, and red river hogs, which are found in West/Central Africa, were considered the same species in the past, but were subsequently redefined as two species around the 1990s, largely due to their quite distinctive looks.
The red river hogs are, as the name implies red, and have long, tufted ears reminiscent of a comical Star Wars character, while eastern and southern African bushpigs are greyish and look more like our own wild boar, although with a beautiful white mane thrown in for good measure.
Biologists have been arguing for decades about whether these two forms are actually one or two different species -- a debate that is characteristic of similar scientific uncertainty surrounding many other African mammals.
""In this study, we were able to conclude that red river hogs and bushpigs have had lots of gene flow, which means they are not only able to potentially interbreed, but they have in fact done so extensively when they have met in central Africa. Furthermore, the branching of the two types in the Tree of Life is not all that old, only a few hundred thousand years, which is not long in the evolutionary scheme of things. Hence, we now know that although there are two quite different-looking lineages of bushpigs, their biological separation is incomplete, depending on how you define species,"" explains Laura D. Bertola, postdoc at the Department of Biology and the other leading author of the study.

Laura continues: ""Genomic data can give us insights into patterns of biodiversity on a much higher resolution than previously possible. For example, we can infer detailed population structure, but also underlying processes like gene flow and selection. Gaining improved insights into patterns of biodiversity and the underlying processes that drive them, will be crucial for effective conservation measures.""
Africa is a unique continent regarding the diversity of the megafauna which is still around. Studying the evolutionary history of these species can give us important insights into African biodiversity, which is highly relevant at a time where biodiversity is being lost at an alarming pace. The new findings contribute to our understanding of prehistoric relations between Africa's humans and wildlife, but also the very fundamentals about how much biodiversity there is on this amazing continent.
""This study is a great example of how involving local researchers and wildlife management authorities can lead to more robust and inclusive scientific research,"" co-author Vincent Muwanika, Associate Professor of Conservation Biology, at Makerere University, Uganda, concludes.
The study is part of the African Wildlife Genomics research framework led by research groups at the Department of Biology at the University of Copenhagen. This research framework is an associated partner project of the African BioGenome Project (https://africanbiogenome.org/) -- an African-led initiative to use genomics in the service of conservation and capacity building in Africa.
The study was supported by the Independent Research Fund Denmark, the Carlsberg Foundation, Villum Foundation and other funding sources.

Bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) and red river hogs (P. porcus) are recognised as separate species due to morphological distinctions, a perceived lack of interbreeding at contact, and putatively old divergence times, but historically, they were considered conspecific. Moreover, the presence of Malagasy bushpigs as the sole large terrestrial mammal shared with the African mainland raises intriguing questions about its origin and arrival in Madagascar. Analyses of 67 whole genomes revealed a genetic continuum between the two species, with putative signatures of historical gene flow, variable FST values, and a recent divergence time (<500,000 years). Thus, our study challenges key arguments for splitting Potamochoerus into two species and suggests their speciation might be incomplete. Our findings also indicate that Malagasy bushpigs diverged from southern African populations and underwent a limited bottleneck 1000-5000 years ago, concurrent with human arrival in Madagascar. These results shed light on the evolutionary history of an iconic and widespread African mammal and provide insight into the longstanding biogeographic puzzle surrounding the bushpig’s presence in Madagascar."

A global study organized and led by Colorado State University scientists shows that the effects of extreme drought -- which is expected to increase in frequency with climate change -- has been greatly underestimated for grasslands and shrublands.

The findings -- published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences -- quantify the impact of extreme short-term drought on grassland and shrubland ecosystems across six continents with a level of detail that was not previously possible.
It is the first time an experiment this extensive has been undertaken to generate a baseline understanding of the potential losses of plant productivity in these vital ecosystems.
Melinda Smith, a professor in the Department of Biology at CSU, led the study and is the first author on the paper. She said the observed reduction in a key carbon cycle process after a single 1-in-100-year drought event greatly exceeds previously reported losses for grasslands and shrublands.
""We were able to determine that the loss of aboveground plant growth -- a key measure of ecosystem function -- was 60% greater when short-term drought was extreme compared to the less severe droughts that have been more commonly experienced historically,"" she said. ""Past studies suffered from methodological differences when estimating the impacts of extreme drought in natural ecosystems, but our standardized, distributed approach here addressed that problem.""
Smith added that the project also showcases the variability in drought response across grassland and shrubland ecosystems -- offering both a review of the global impacts of climate change as well as a glimpse into which areas will be most stressed or most resilient in the coming years.
Gathering global extreme drought data on grassland and shrubland ecosystems Known as the International Drought Experiment, the newly published research originally dates back to 2013 as part of the National Science Foundation's Drought-Net Research Coordination Network. Altogether, there are more than 170 authors representing institutions from around the world cited in the new PNAS study, which was completed over the last four years.

To gather their data, researchers built rainfall manipulation structures to experimentally reduce the amount of naturally occurring precipitation available to ecosystems for at least a full growing season. About half of the participating sites imposed extreme drought conditions with these structures, while the rest imposed less severe drought for comparison.
As Earth's climate continues to change, short-term droughts that are statistically extreme in intensity will become more common, with what were once considered 1-in-100-year droughts now potentially happening every two to five years, said Smith. But because of the historic rarity of extreme droughts researchers had been unable to estimate the actual magnitude of their ecological consequences.
Smith said grasslands and shrublands were perfect test areas to fill that research gap because they are easier to manipulate for study than other systems, such as forests. They also store more than 30% of the global stock of carbon and support key industries such as livestock production.
""They are key ecosystems that are scalable to the globe, which makes them highly relevant for this kind of work,"" said Smith, who also serves as chair of the Faculty Council on campus. ""Grasslands and shrublands cover between 30% and 40% of the globe and frequently see deficits in precipitation. That means they are more vulnerable to climate change.""
Findings from the sites also provide insight into how specific climates, soil and vegetation types broadly influence drought response. While the work shows that drier and less diverse sites like those in Colorado are likely to be the most vulnerable to extremes, Smith said the severity of the drought was the most consistent and important factor in determining an ecosystem's response.
""Our data suggests greater losses in drier sites, but if you are getting to the extremes -- which is what is being forecasted -- we can generally expect substantial losses no matter where you are in the world,"" she said. ""We also found that even moderate losses from less severe droughts would still likely result in large impacts to the populations that rely on these systems. And then there is a combined loss of function across the globe to consider as well.""
Smith said the team is currently examining data collected from the full four years of the project to now assess multiyear drought impacts globally.

Yet the impact of this intensification of drought on ecosystem functioning remains poorly resolved. This is due in part to the widely disparate approaches ecologists have employed to study drought, variation in the severity and duration of drought studied, and differences among ecosystems in vegetation, edaphic and climatic attributes that can mediate drought impacts. To overcome these problems and better identify the factors that modulate drought responses, we used a coordinated distributed experiment to quantify the impact of short-term drought on grassland and shrubland ecosystems. With a standardized approach, we imposed ~a single year of drought at 100 sites on six continents. Here we show that loss of a foundational ecosystem function—aboveground net primary production (ANPP)—was 60% greater at sites that experienced statistically extreme drought (1-in-100-y event) vs. those sites where drought was nominal (historically more common) in magnitude (35% vs. 21%, respectively). This reduction in a key carbon cycle process with a single year of extreme drought greatly exceeds previously reported losses for grasslands and shrublands. Our global experiment also revealed high variability in drought response but that relative reductions in ANPP were greater in drier ecosystems and those with fewer plant species. Overall, our results demonstrate with unprecedented rigor that the global impacts of projected increases in drought severity have been significantly underestimated and that drier and less diverse sites are likely to be most vulnerable to extreme drought."

Researchers at McMaster University have discovered a molecular ""barcode"" system used by disease-causing bacteria to distinguish between beneficial and toxic molecules.

Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the new study shows that many bacteria can figuratively scan genetic codes to learn which proteins to keep and which proteins to expel into the environment.
According to researchers, those proteins that are expelled are often toxic to human cells, making the ability to differentiate between proteins vital to a bacterium's capacity for causing infectious disease.
""Proteins are one of the fundamental building blocks of life,"" explains John Whitney, an associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster and the lead investigator on the study. ""They quite literally allow bacterial pathogens to do everything that they do. And while the vast majority of proteins remain inside bacteria to carry out functions like metabolism, there is a very small subset that act outside of the organism -- like toxins.""
Whitney, a member of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research, says that although the bacterial secretion system and the toxins themselves have long been studied, it was not understood how bacteria discriminated between toxic and non-toxic proteins prior to the study.
Whitney's lab, led by biochemistry graduate students Prakhar Shah and Timothy Klein (now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Francisco), questioned how three fundamentally different toxins could all be secreted by the same bacterial secretion system.
""There were no known similarities between the toxins -- they don't look anything alike, and they don't do anything similar,"" Whitney says. ""Our rationale was, for them to all pass through the same protein secretion machine, there must be something common between them.""
Sure enough, there was. Each toxin shared a ""domain,"" which Whitney colloquially compares to a barcode. He says that while the barcode was shared by all three toxins under study, it was absent from the other three-thousand-or-so proteins in the bacteria, indicating that it serves as the export signal.

Shah, who co-first authored the study with Klein, says the team was able to prove this concept experimentally through a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches, including important ""X-ray crystallography studies"" that allowed them to purify the proteins and get a clearer view of the so-called barcodes and how they functioned.
The research team believes that this new information could eventually have a range of important biotechnology and infectious disease-related applications. In particular, Shah notes that the findings are relevant to our understanding of an array of gram-positive pathogens, including the kinds of bacteria responsible for serious infectious diseases like tuberculosis and listeriosis.
""A lot of pathogens use this system,"" Shah says. ""Therefore, our discovery has important implications on our understanding of the virulence strategies used by a wide range of human pathogens.""

Many of these effectors are polymorphic toxins comprised of an N-terminal Leu-x-Gly (LXG) domain of unknown function and a C-terminal toxin domain that inhibits the growth of bacterial competitors. In recent work, it was shown that LXG effectors require two cognate Lap proteins for T7SS-dependent export. Here, we present the 2.6 Å structure of the LXG domain of the TelA toxin from the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus intermedius in complex with both of its cognate Lap targeting factors. The structure reveals an elongated α-helical bundle within which each Lap protein makes extensive hydrophobic contacts with either end of the LXG domain. Remarkably, despite low overall sequence identity, we identify striking structural similarity between our LXG complex and PE–PPE heterodimers exported by the distantly related ESX type VII secretion systems of Mycobacteria implying a conserved mechanism of effector export among diverse Gram-positive bacteria. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LXG domains, in conjunction with their cognate Lap targeting factors, represent a tripartite secretion signal for a widespread family of T7SS toxins."

When imagining corals, the picture that comes to mind is usually a stationary one: a garden of rock-like structures covering sections of the ocean floor.

Reef conservation efforts typically focus on preserving established coral and protecting them from known stressors such as pollution, overfishing and runoff from coastline populations.
However, new research near Miloliʻi in the southwestern part of the island of Hawaii, shows that identifying and protecting marine ecosystems both down-current and up-current of coral reefs, specifically areas where coral larvae are more likely to survive and thrive, is crucial to future coral conservation and restoration efforts -- especially as reefs face increasing pressure from the devastating effects of climate change.
The research, completed by Arizona State University scientists and their collaborators, appears in the current issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Rachel Carlson, an ASU affiliate scientist and the study's first author, along with Greg Asner, director of ASU's Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science, Larry Crowder, professor of oceans at Stanford University, and Robin Martin, associate professor with the ASU School of Ocean Futures in the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory, collaborated on the project.
Additionally, the ʻĀkoʻakoʻa Reef Restoration Program, a regional effort that fuses cultural leadership, multi-modal education, advanced science and government engagement, backed the research.
Carlson says this type of collaborative work -- partnerships combining local, Indigenous knowledge and Western science -- is crucial to mapping out a future that ensures the survival of coral populations.

""There's a lot of Indigenous knowledge about coral spawning and fish populations in West Hawaii. In this study, we addressed an open question: How connected are coral populations between embayments along this coastline?"" Carlson said. ""What we essentially found is that the major factors in helping the coral keiki, known as larvae, settle down and survive are the nearshore current and the structure of the reef.""
The study shows that the larvae more often settle in and inhabit areas with large boulders and uneven surfaces, or ""chunky features,"" said Carlson, who is also a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow at the UC Davis Bodega Marine Lab. Adult coral will spawn millions of larvae into the water column and those larvae prefer to settle in places with large knolls and boulders.
This discovery is good news: These kinds of seafloor features have been mapped via ASU's Global Airborne Observatory, a highly specialized aircraft that uses several types of remote sensing technologies to track both underwater and land-based habitats. This means that the researchers have the capability to help find and map priority reefs for conservation and restoration.
""This is foundational research in several important ways,"" said Asner, the study's senior author. ""First, it gives us an understanding of the connectivity of different parts of reefs along our coastline and tells us the level of connectivity in the context of the birth, settlement and growth of corals miles apart. Second, our unique remote sensing capabilities can identify reef sites where coral restoration could be most viable in the future. Finally, these findings provide a critical building block for future restoration efforts by our ʻĀkoʻakoʻa team and collaborators.""
The group's goal is to preserve and restore vitality to Hawaii's coral reefs and coastline health.
""We as lineal descendants of the Miloliʻi area have always relied on the reef for our ʻOhana (families). Our reef is our sustenance and is of enormous cultural value to us,"" said Kaʻimi Kaupiko, president of the nonprofit organization Kalanihale, which manages the Miloliʻi Community-Based Subsistence Fishing Area where the study took place.

Asner said the intertwined nature of reefs along Hawaii's coastlines is crucial to consider in reef protection strategies. Narrowing in on one area without consideration for the reproductive corridors of corals, he said, would be akin to worrying about planting trees in a certain place and not thinking about the forest as a whole. This sentiment is echoed by Martin, who said reef connectivity is an underutilized tool in reef restoration efforts globally.
""In Hawaii and worldwide, we're trying to figure out where we should place protections and restore areas to help reefs,"" Martin said. ""This study is highly technical, but it needs to be part of that conversation and part of that work, because if you aren't protecting the upcurrent reefs, you are cutting off important reproductive areas.""
Martin said reef restoration could, for example, expand a protected area of reefs beyond just the spots that have more dense coral coverage on the ocean floor; protection efforts would also be needed in the upcurrent path that the coral larvae traveled through before they settled in a new location.
Asner adds that this research could very well help conservation efforts expand to much greater distances than have been achieved previously.
""These kinds of studies of connectivity, flow and movement are needed because the west Hawaii island coastline is longer than the whole circumference of any other island,"" Asner said. ""We have a lot of degraded reefs along our coastline, so knowing where and how to help baby corals thrive is fundamental to the ʻĀkoʻakoʻa restoration effort.""
""Our students participated in the coral study, and that also helped us to connect the dots between cultural knowledge and Western science,"" Kaupiko said. ""The study supports our (community-based subsistence fishing area) by showing that our area is ecologically connected, and thus it needs to be managed and protected as one connected reef and coastlin

Coral reef morphology—the structural form of reef substrate—affects many aspects of reef function, yet the effect of reef morphology on coral recruitment is not well understood. We used structure-from-motion photogrammetry and airborne remote sensing to measure reef morphology (rugosity, curvature, slope, and fractal dimension) across a broad continuum of spatial scales and evaluated the effect of morphology on coral recruitment in three broadcast-spawning genera. We also measured the effect of other environmental and biotic factors such as fish density, adult coral cover, hydrodynamic larval import, and depth on coral recruitment. All variables combined explained 72% of coral recruitment in the study region. Coarse reef rugosity and curvature mapped at ≥2 m spatial resolution—such as large colonies, knolls, and boulders—were positively correlated with coral recruitment, explaining 22% of variation in recruitment. Morphology mapped at finer scales (≤32 cm resolution) was not significant. Hydrodynamic larval import was also positively related to coral recruitment in Porites and Montipora spp., and grazer fish density was linked to significantly lower recruitment in all genera. In addition, grazer density, reef morphology, and hydrodynamic import had differential effects on coral genera, reflecting genus-specific life history traits, and model performance was lower in gonochoric species. Overall, coral reef morphology is a key indicator of recruitment potential that can be detected by remote sensing, allowing potential larval sinks to be identified and factored into restoration actions."

An international team of researchers has found that Africa's birds of prey are facing an extinction crisis.

The report, co-led by researchers from the School of Biology at the University of St Andrews and The Peregrine Fund, and published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution (4 January 2024), warns of declines among nearly 90% of 42 species examined, and suggests that more than two-thirds may qualify as globally threatened.
Led by Dr Phil Shaw from St Andrews and Dr Darcy Ogada of The Peregrine Fund, the study combines counts from road surveys conducted within four African regions at intervals of c. 20-40 years and yields unprecedented insights into patterns of change in the abundance of savanna raptor species.
It shows that large raptor species had experienced significantly steeper declines than smaller species, particularly on unprotected land, where they are more vulnerable to persecution and other human pressures. Overall, raptors had declined more than twice as rapidly outside of National Parks, Reserves and other protected areas than they had within. Worryingly, many species experiencing the steepest declines had suffered a double jeopardy, having also become much more dependent on protected areas over the course of the study.
The study's authors conclude that unless many of the threats currently facing African raptors are addressed effectively, large, charismatic eagle and vulture species are unlikely to persist over much of the continent's unprotected land by the latter half of this century.
The study also highlights steep declines among raptors that are currently classified as being of 'least concern' in the global Red List of threatened species. They include African endemics such as Wahlberg's Eagle, African Hawk-eagle, Long-crested Eagle, African Harrier-hawk and Brown Snake-eagle, as well as Dark Chanting-goshawk. All of these species have declined at rates suggesting that they may now be globally threatened.
Several other familiar, widespread raptor species are now scarce or absent from unprotected land. They include one of Africa's most powerful raptors -- the Martial Eagle -- as well as the highly distinctive Bateleur.

Dr Phil Shaw commented: ""Since the 1970s, extensive areas of forest and savanna have been converted into farmland, while other pressures affecting African raptors have likewise intensified. With the human population projected to double in the next 35 years, the need to extend Africa's protected area network -- and mitigate pressures in unprotected areas -- is now greater than ever.""
Dr Darcy Ogada added: ""Africa is at a crossroads in terms of saving its magnificent birds of prey. In many areas we have watched these species nearly disappear. One of Africa's most iconic raptors, the Secretarybird, is on the brink of extinction. There's no single threat imperiling these birds, it's a combination of many human-caused ones, in other words we are seeing deaths from a thousand cuts.""
Professor Ian Newton OBE FRS, FRSE, a world-leading ornithologist who was not involved in the study, commented: ""This is an important paper which draws attention to the massive declines in predatory birds which have occurred across much of Africa during recent decades. This was the continent over which, only 50 years ago, pristine populations of spectacular raptors were evident almost everywhere, bringing excitement and wonder to visitors from many parts of the world. The causes of the declines are many -- from rampant habitat destruction to growing use of poisons by farmers and poachers and expanding powerline networks -- all ultimately due to expansions in human numbers, livestock grazing and other activities. Let us hope that more research can be done and, more importantly, that these birds can be protected over ever more areas, measures largely dependent on the education and goodwill of local people.""
Raptors of all sizes lead an increasingly perilous existence on Africa's unprotected land, where suitable habitat, food supplies and breeding sites have been drastically reduced, and persecution from pastoralists, ivory poachers and farmers is now widespread. Other significant threats include unintentional poisoning, electrocution on power poles and collision with powerlines and wind turbines, as well as killing for food and belief-based uses.
The late Dr Jean Marc Thiollay laid the foundation for this study in the 1970s, by initiating a remarkable long-term monitoring effort in West Africa, where the average decline rate was more than twice that of other regions. The Peregrine Fund's Dr Ralph Buij, who has re-surveyed some of the original areas, noted that: ""the human footprint is particularly high throughout West Africa's savannas, and the near complete disappearance of many raptors outside that region's relatively small and fragmented protected area network reflects an ecological collapse that is increasingly affecting other parts of the continent. Some raptors that occur mostly in West Africa, such as the little-known Beaudouin's Snake-eagle, are vanishing into oblivion.""
The study's findings highlight the importance of strengthening the protection of Africa's natural habitats and aligns with the Convention on Biological Diversity's COP15 goal of expanding conservation areas to cover 30% of land by 2030. They also demonstrate the need to restore natural habitats within unprotected areas, reduce the impact of energy infrastructure, improve legislation for species protection, and establish long-term monitoring and evaluation of the conservation status of African raptors. Crucially, there is a pressing need to try to increase public involvement in raptor conservation efforts.
To this end, the study's authors have developed the African Raptor Leadership Grant to address the immediate need for more research and conservation programs. It supports educational and mentoring opportunities for emerging African scientists, boosting local conservation initiatives and knowledge of raptors across the continent. This initiative, which was launched in 2023, awarded its first grant to Joan Banda, a raptor research student at AP Leventis Ornithological Research Institute in Nigeria, who will be studying threats to African owls.

Many of Africa’s raptors are at considerable risk from habitat conversion, prey-base depletion and persecution, driven principally by human population expansion. Here we describe multiregional trends among 42 African raptor species, 88% of which have declined over a ca. 20–40-yr period, with 69% exceeding the International Union for Conservation of Nature criteria classifying species at risk of extinction. Large raptors had experienced significantly steeper declines than smaller species, and this disparity was more pronounced on unprotected land. Declines were greater in West Africa than elsewhere, and more than twice as severe outside of protected areas (PAs) than within.

Certain populations of mosquitoes are more heat tolerant and better equipped to survive heat waves than others, according to new research from Washington University in St. Louis.

This is bad news in a world where vector-borne diseases are an increasingly global health concern. Most models that scientists use to estimate vector-borne disease risk currently assume that mosquito heat tolerances do not vary. As a result, these models may underestimate mosquitoes' ability to spread diseases in a warming world.
Researchers led by Katie M. Westby, a senior scientist at Tyson Research Center, Washington University's environmental field station, conducted a new study that measured the critical thermal maximum (CTmax), an organism's upper thermal tolerance limit, of eight populations of the globally invasive tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. The tiger mosquito is a known vector for many viruses including West Nile, chikungunya and dengue.
""We found significant differences across populations for both adults and larvae, and these differences were more pronounced for adults,"" Westby said. The new study is published Jan. 8 in Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.
Westby's team sampled mosquitoes from eight different populations spanning four climate zones across the eastern United States, including mosquitoes from locations in New Orleans; St. Augustine, Fla.; Huntsville, Ala.; Stillwater, Okla.; St. Louis; Urbana, Ill.; College Park, Md.; and Allegheny County, Pa.
The scientists collected eggs in the wild and raised larvae from the different geographic locations to adult stages in the lab, tending the mosquito populations separately as they continued to breed and grow. The scientists then used adults and larvae from subsequent generations of these captive-raised mosquitoes in trials to determine CTmax values, ramping up air and water temperatures at a rate of 1 degree Celsius per minute using established research protocols.
The team then tested the relationship between climatic variables measured near each population source and the CTmax of adults and larvae. The scientists found significant differences among the mosquito populations.

The differences did not appear to follow a simple latitudinal or temperature-dependent pattern, but there were some important trends. Mosquito populations from locations with higher precipitation had higher CTmax values. Overall, the results reveal that mean and maximum seasonal temperatures, relative humidity and annual precipitation may all be important climatic factors in determining CTmax.
""Larvae had significantly higher thermal limits than adults, and this likely results from different selection pressures for terrestrial adults and aquatic larvae,"" said Benjamin Orlinick, first author of the paper and a former undergraduate research fellow at Tyson Research Center. ""It appears that adult Ae. albopictus are experiencing temperatures closer to their CTmax than larvae, possibly explaining why there are more differences among adult populations.""
""The overall trend is for increased heat tolerance with increasing precipitation,"" Westby said. ""It could be that wetter climates allow mosquitoes to endure hotter temperatures due to decreases in desiccation, as humidity and temperature are known to interact and influence mosquito survival.""
Little is known about how different vector populations, like those of this kind of mosquito, are adapted to their local climate, nor the potential for vectors to adapt to a rapidly changing climate. This study is one of the few to consider the upper limits of survivability in high temperatures -- akin to heat waves -- as opposed to the limits imposed by cold winters.
""Standing genetic variation in heat tolerance is necessary for organisms to adapt to higher temperatures,"" Westby said. ""That's why it was important for us to experimentally determine if this mosquito exhibits variation before we can begin to test how, or if, it will adapt to a warmer world.""
Future research in the lab aims to determine the upper limits that mosquitoes will seek out hosts for blood meals in the field, where they spend the hottest parts of the day when temperatures get above those thresholds, and if they are already adapting to higher temperatures. ""Determining this is key to understanding how climate change will impact disease transmission in the real world,"" Westby said. ""Mosquitoes in the wild experience fluctuating daily temperatures and humidity that we cannot fully replicate in the lab.""

Understanding the ecology and evolution of vector species is critical to predicting and combating VBD. Vectorial capacity models, used to forecast disease transmission, traditionally assume traits are constant among populations, and little is known about whether different vector populations vary in thermal tolerance. To test for geographic variation in upper thermal tolerance, we determined the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of Aedes albopictus, a globally distributed mosquito and competent vector for many viruses including West Nile, chikungunya, and dengue. We studied CTmax for eight different populations spanning four climate zones across the Eastern United States using common garden experiments to isolate genetic variation. To explore potential drivers of this variation we then tested the relationship between climatic variables measured near each population source and CTmax. We found significant differences across populations for both adults and larvae, and these differences were more pronounced for adults. Larvae had higher CTmax values compared to adults. Several climatic variables improved models of CTmax for both adults and larvae including mean and max seasonal temperature, annual precipitation, and relative humidity. Annual precipitation appears to be particularly important and has a positive linear relationship with CTmax. The differences between life stages likely result from different selection pressures experienced in their terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Importantly, the assumption that mosquito populations within a species have the same upper thermal limits does not hold in this case, thus it is important to use population-specific CTmax values, among other important physiological parameters that may vary, to more accurately model and forecast VBDs."

Researchers from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) have developed a new AI-powered algorithm to help understand how different cells organize themselves into particular tissues and communicate with one another. This new tool was tested on two types of cancer tissues to reveal how these ""neighborhoods"" of cells interact with one another to evade therapy, and more studies could reveal more information about the function of these cells in the tumor microenvironment.

The findings were published online today by the journal Nature Methods.
To understand how different cells organize themselves to support the functions of a tissue, researchers proposed the concept of tissue cellular neighborhoods (TCNs) to describe functional units in which different, recurrent cell types work together to support specific tissue functions. Across individuals, the functions of these TCNs would remain the same. However, translating the huge amount of information in spatial omics data into models and hypotheses that can be interpreted and tested by researchers requires advanced AI algorithms.
""It is very difficult to study the tissue microenvironment, how certain cells organize, behave and communicate with one another,"" said senior study author Kai Tan, PhD, an investigator in the Center for Childhood Cancer Research at CHOP and a professor in the Department of Pediatrics and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Until recent advances in so-called spatial omics technology, it was impossible to spatially characterize more than 100 proteins or hundreds or even thousands of genes across a piece of tissue, which might be home to hundreds of thousands of cells and their respective genes.""
In this study, researchers developed the deep-learning-based CytoCommunity algorithm to identify TCNs based on cell identities of a tissue sample, their spatial distributions as well as patient clinical data, which can help researchers better understand how these neighborhoods of cells are organized and are associated with certain clinical outcomes. In this study, tissue samples from breast and colorectal tumors were used because of a high volume of data available, enough to train the algorithm to identify TCNs associated with high-risk disease subtypes.
By using CytoCommunity for breast and colorectal cancer data, the algorithm revealed new fibroblast-enriched TCNs and granulocyte-enriched TCNs specific to high-risk breast cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively.
""Since we were able to prove the effectiveness of CytoCommunity, the next step is to apply this algorithm to both healthy and diseased tissue data generated by research consortia such as HuBMAP (Human BioMolecular Atlas Program) and HTAN (Human Tumor Atlas Network)"" Tan said. ""For instance, using data from childhood cancers such as leukemia, neuroblastoma and high-grade gliomas, we hope to find tissue cellular neighborhoods that might be associated with responses to certain therapies and combine our findings with genetic data to help determine which genetic pathways may be involved at the cellular and molecular levels.""

Using several types of spatial omics data, we demonstrate that CytoCommunity can identify TCNs of variable sizes with substantial improvement over existing methods. By analyzing risk-stratified colorectal and breast cancer data, CytoCommunity revealed new granulocyte-enriched and cancer-associated fibroblast-enriched TCNs specific to high-risk tumors and altered interactions between neoplastic and immune or stromal cells within and between TCNs.

Some bacterial membrane transporters work almost like freight elevators to transport substances through the cell membrane into the interior of the cell. The transporter itself spans the bacterial membrane. Like a forklift, a soluble protein outside the bacterium transports the substance to the ""elevator"" and unloads its cargo there. The freight elevator transports it to the inside of the cell, in other words to another floor.

Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn (UKB) and the University of Bonn, in collaboration with a team from the University of York, have now studied the interaction between the transporter and its soluble substrate binding protein. Interestingly, they adapt precisely to each other during the transportation process. As this happens very quickly, the researchers virtually ""blocked"" the elevator by specifically inserting anchors, so-called disulphide bridges. This enabled them to prove that only the loaded ""forklift"" fits the ""elevator"" if it is on the right floor. This makes transportation really effective. The study has now been published in the journal Nature Communications.
Like all cells, bacteria are also surrounded by a cell membrane. This thin layer of lipids encloses nutrients, genetic material and proteins of the cell. However, certain substances must be able to pass through the membrane. For example, substances that help pathogens to evade the human body's immune response. To this end, pathogenic bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae have so-called ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters. They have two very flexible transmembrane domains that span the cell wall. The pathogen Haemophilus influenzae uses the TRAP transporter to transport sialic acid from its environment into the cell interior, which is then incorporated into the bacterial cell wall. The small sugar molecule is very common in human tissue. ""Once it is incorporated into the bacterial cell wall, the sialic acid acts like a camouflage cap for the bacteria. This allows them to hide from our immune system because it makes them look similar to the body's own tissue,"" says PD Dr. Gregor Hagelueken from the Institute of Structural Biology at the UKB. He is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) ""Life & Health"" and the Immunosensation2 Cluster of Excellence at the University of Bonn.
Protein catches substance like a Venus flytrap
The TRAP transporter is supported by an additional substrate binding protein (SBP), which searches for sialic acid outside the bacterial membrane. Once this ""forklift"" has found a sugar molecule, the SBP changes its shape and binds the sialic acid tightly. ""This binding process can be compared to the snapping shut of a Venus flytrap,"" says Philipp Hendricks, one of the first authors of the study and a doctoral student at the Institute of Structural Biology at the University of Bonn.
It has long been suspected that the TRAP transporter recognizes the closed form of the substrate binding protein. The Bonn researchers therefore investigated whether the opening and closing of the SBP and the upward and downward movement of the TRAP transporter are actually coupled to each other. Because these movements are very fast, Hagelueken's team used what is known as disulphide engineering, a special biotechnological tool, to block the transporter. ""We locked the 'elevator' on different floors, so to speak -- either inside the cell or outside,"" says first author Dr. Martin Peter. He was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Structural Biology and is now a researcher at Heidelberg University.
Bacterial freight elevator made visible with fluorescence microscopy
In collaboration with the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Ulrich Kubitscheck at the Clausius Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Bonn, the researchers were able to incorporate the TRAP transporter into artificial membranes. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, they were able to precisely observe the binding between the TRAP transporter and the ""forklift"" and thus watch them live at work. ""Our experiments showed that the movements of the SBP and those of the transmembrane elevator are indeed coupled with each other,"" says first author Jan A. Ruland, postdoctoral researcher at the Clausius Institute at the University of Bonn. Thus, the SBP in its closed state preferentially binds to the inward-facing membrane elevator and the ""open"" SBP to the outward-facing TRAP transporter. ""These new insights into the mechanism of the transporter may help in the future to develop antibiotics that ensure that the elevators of bacteria get stuck. This would put an end to the game of hide-and-seek and our immune system could destroy the bacteria more easily,"" summarizes Hagelueken from the UKB.

The SBP can adopt an open- or closed state depending on the presence of substrate. The two transmembrane domains of TRAP transporters form a monomeric elevator whose function is strictly dependent on the presence of a sodium ion gradient. Insights from experimental structures, structural predictions and molecular modeling have suggested a conformational coupling between the membrane elevator and the substrate binding protein. Here, we use a disulfide engineering approach to lock the TRAP transporter HiSiaPQM from Haemophilus influenzae in different conformational states. The SBP, HiSiaP, is locked in its substrate-bound form and the transmembrane elevator, HiSiaQM, is locked in either its assumed inward- or outward-facing states. We characterize the disulfide-locked constructs and use single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to study their interactions. Our experiments demonstrate that the SBP and the transmembrane elevator are indeed conformationally coupled, meaning that the open and closed state of the SBP recognize specific conformational states of the transporter and vice versa."

A groundbreaking study has found that evolution is not as unpredictable as previously thought, which could allow scientists to explore which genes could be useful to tackle real-world issues such as antibiotic resistance, disease and climate change.

The study, which is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), challenges the long-standing belief about the unpredictability of evolution, and has found that the evolutionary trajectory of a genome may be influenced by its evolutionary history, rather than determined by numerous factors and historical accidents.
The study was led by Professor James McInerney and Dr. Alan Beavan from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham, and Dr. Maria Rosa Domingo-Sananes from Nottingham Trent University.
""The implications of this research are nothing short of revolutionary,"" said Professor McInerney, the lead author of the study. ""By demonstrating that evolution is not as random as we once thought, we've opened the door to an array of possibilities in synthetic biology, medicine, and environmental science.""
The team carried out an analysis of the pangenome -- the complete set of genes within a given species, to answer a critical question of whether evolution is predictable or whether the evolutionary paths of genomes are dependent on their history and so not predictable today.
Using a machine learning approach known as Random Forest, along with a dataset of 2,500 complete genomes from a single bacterial species, the team carried out several hundred thousand hours of computer processing to address the question.
After feeding the data into their high-performance computer, the team first made ""gene families"" from each of the gene of each genome.

""In this way, we could compare like-with-like across the genomes,"" said Dr. Domingo-Sananes.
Once the families had been identified, the team analysed the pattern of how these families were present in some genomes and absent in others.
""We found that some gene families never turned up in a genome when a particular other gene family was already there, and on other occasions, some genes were very much dependent on a different gene family being present.""
In effect, the researchers discovered an invisible ecosystem where genes can cooperate or can be in conflict with one another.
""These interactions between genes make aspects of evolution somewhat predictable and furthermore, we now have a tool that allows us to make those predictions,"" adds Dr. Domingo-Sananes.
Dr Beavan said: ""From this work, we can begin to explore which genes ""support"" an antibiotic resistance gene, for example. Therefore, if we are trying to eliminate antibiotic resistance, we can target not just the focal gene, but we can also target its supporting genes.
""We can use this approach to synthesise new kinds of genetic constructs that could be used to develop new drugs or vaccines. Knowing what we now know has opened the door to a whole host of other discoveries.""
The implications of the research are far-reaching and could lead to: Novel Genome Design -- allowing scientists to design synthetic genomes, providing a roadmap for the predictable manipulation of genetic material. Combatting Antibiotic Resistance -- Understanding the dependencies between genes can help identify the 'supporting cast' of genes that make antibiotic resistance possible, paving the way for targeted treatments. Climate Change Mitigation -- Insights from the study could inform the design of microorganisms engineered to capture carbon or degrade pollutants, thereby contributing to efforts to combat climate change. Medical Applications -- The predictability of gene interactions could revolutionise personalised medicine by providing new metrics for disease risk and treatment efficacy.

Repeated acquisitions of near-identical homologs can easily be observed across pangenomes, leading to the question of whether these parallel events potentiate similar evolutionary trajectories, or whether the remarkably different genetic backgrounds of the recipients mean that postacquisition evolutionary trajectories end up being quite different. In this study, we present a machine learning method that predicts the presence or absence of genes in the Escherichia coli pangenome based on complex patterns of the presence or absence of other accessory genes within a genome. Our analysis leverages the repeated transfer of genes through the E. coli pangenome to observe patterns of repeated evolution following similar events. We find that the presence or absence of a substantial set of genes is highly predictable from other genes alone, indicating that selection potentiates and maintains gene–gene co-occurrence and avoidance relationships deterministically over long-term bacterial evolution and is robust to differences in host evolutionary history. We propose that at least part of the pangenome can be understood as a set of genes with relationships that govern their likely cohabitants, analogous to an ecosystem’s set of interacting organisms. Our findings indicate that intragenomic gene fitness effects may be key drivers of prokaryotic evolution, influencing the repeated emergence of complex gene–gene relationships across the pangenome."

As concerns over the world's declining bird population mount, animal ecologists developed an analytical approach to better understand one of the latest threats to feathered creatures: the rise of wind and solar energy facilities.

""Bird mortality has become an unintended consequence of renewable energy development,"" said Hannah Vander Zanden, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Florida. ""If we want to minimize or even offset these fatalities, especially for vulnerable populations, we need to identify the geographic origin of affected birds. In other words, are the dead birds local or are they coming from other parts of North America?""
Birds can be killed when they collide with wind turbines, fly into solar panels they mistake for bodies of water or become singed by the intense heat from concentrating solar power plants. While the death rate of birds due to these energy facilities is far less than deaths due to domestic cats and collisions with building, efforts to mitigate this problem is important, scientists say.
Vander Zanden and colleagues performed geospatial analyses of stable hydrogen isotope data obtained from feathers of 871 individual birds found dead at solar and wind energy facilities in California, representing 24 species.
Their analysis of natural-occurring markers in the feathers provided information about where the feathers were grown based on the water the birds consumed.
""With these markers, we could determine whether the bird was local or if it was migrating from somewhere else,"" said Vander Zanden, who is the principal investigator of UF's Animal Migration and Ecology Lab.
Results from the study, which were published Friday in the journal Conservation Biology, show that the birds killed at the facilities were from a broad area across the continent. Their geographical origins varied among species and included a mix of local and nonlocal birds.

Researchers found most birds killed at solar facilities were nonlocal and peaked during the migratory periods of April and September through October. The percentage of migratory birds found at wind facilities nearly matched that of local birds, at 51%, Vander Zanden said.
""This kind of data can help inform us about best strategies to use to minimize or mitigate the fatalities,"" she said. ""For example, facilities management could work with conservationists to improve the local habitat to help protect local birds or improve other parts of the species' range where the migratory birds originate.""
The results also illustrate the power of stable isotope data to assess future population growth or decline patterns for birds due to a variety of reasons.
""Studying the remains of animals is a noninvasive approach to get information that is otherwise hard to track and apply to conservation,"" Vander Zanden said. ""It's a great way to understand the mysteries about animals.""

Wind and solar energy can reduce emissions of fossil fuels that drive anthropogenic climate change, yet renewable‐energy production represents a potential threat to bird species. Surveys to assess potential effects at renewable‐energy facilities are exclusively local, and the geographic extent encompassed by birds killed at these facilities is largely unknown, which creates challenges for minimizing and mitigating the population‐level and cumulative effects of these fatalities. We performed geospatial analyses of stable hydrogen isotope data obtained from feathers of 871 individuals of 24 bird species found dead at solar‐ and wind‐energy facilities in California (USA). Most species had individuals with a mix of origins, ranging from 23% to 98% nonlocal. Mean minimum distances to areas of likely origin for nonlocal individuals were as close as 97 to >1250 km, and these minimum distances were larger for species found at solar‐energy facilities in deserts than at wind‐energy facilities in grasslands (Cohen's d = 6.5). Fatalities were drawn from an estimated 30–100% of species’ desingated ranges, and this percentage was significantly smaller for species with large ranges found at wind facilities (Pearson's r = −0.67). Temporal patterns in the geographic origin of fatalities suggested that migratory movements and nonmigratory movements, such as dispersal and nomadism, influence exposure to fatality risk for these birds. Our results illustrate the power of using stable isotope data to assess the geographic extent of renewable‐energy fatalities on birds. As the buildout of renewable‐energy facilities continues, accurate assessment of the geographic footprint of wildlife fatalities can be used to inform compensatory mitigation for their population‐level and cumulative effects."

Conservation measures have successfully stopped declines in the African savanna elephant population across southern Africa, but the pattern varies locally, according to a new study.

The evidence suggests that the long-term solution to elephant survival requires not only that areas are protected but that they are also connected to allow populations to stabilize naturally, an international research team says.
Their study, published on January 5th in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances, collected survey estimates and calculated growth rates for more than 100 elephant populations in southern Africa between 1995 and 2020, accounting for an estimated 70% of the global savanna elephant population.
""This is the most comprehensive analysis of growth rates for any large mammal population in the world,"" said co-author Rob Guldemond, director of the Conservation Ecological Research Unit (CERU) at the University of Pretoria, in South Africa.
Overall, the survey's results are positive: There are the same number of elephants now as there were 25 years ago, a rare conservation win at a time when the planet is rapidly losing biodiversity. However, the pattern is not consistent across regions. Some areas, such as south Tanzania, eastern Zambia, and northern Zimbabwe, experienced severe declines due to illegal ivory poaching. In contrast, populations in other regions like north Botswana are booming.
""Unchecked growth isn't necessarily a good thing, however,"" says study co-author Stuart Pimm, the Doris Duke Professor of Conservation at Duke University in North Carolina. ""Rapidly increasing populations can outgrow and damage their local environment and prove hard to manage -- introducing a threat to their long-term stability,"" Pimm says.
In addition to documenting local growth rates, the team also looked at the features of the local populations to identify what makes them stable, that is neither growing nor declining.

Elephant populations in well-protected but isolated parks, sometimes called ""fortress conservation,"" grow rapidly in the absence of threats but are unsustainable in the long term. These elephants will likely need future conservation interventions, such as translocation or birth control, which are both costly and intensive endeavors.
The team found that the most stable populations occur in large, core areas that are surrounded by buffer zones. The core areas are defined by their strong levels of environmental protection and minimal human impact, whereas the buffers allow some activities such as sustainable farming, forestry, or trophy hunting. Unlike the insular fortresses, core areas are connected to other parks, allowing herds to move naturally.
""What's crucial is that you need a mix of areas with more stable core populations linked to more variable buffer areas,"" said lead author Ryan Huang, a Duke Ph.D. now doing postdoctoral research at CERU.
""These buffers absorb immigrants when core populations get too high, but also provide escape routes when elephants face poor environmental conditions or other threats such as poaching,"" Huang said.
Connecting protected areas means elephants can freely move in and out. This allows a natural equilibrium to occur without human intervention, sparing conservationists from using their limited resources to maintain balance.
""Calling for connecting parks isn't something new. Many have done so,"" Huang said. ""But surprisingly, there has not been a lot of published evidence of its effectiveness so far. This study helps quantify why this works.""
""Connecting protected areas is essential for the survival of African savanna elephants and many other animal and plant species,"" said Celesté Maré, co-author and doctoral student at Aarhus University in Denmark. ""Populations with more options for moving around are healthier and more stable, which is important given an uncertain future from climate change.""

Across southern Africa, elephant numbers grew at 0.16% annually for the past quarter century. Locally, much depends on metapopulation dynamics—the size and connections of individual populations. Population numbers in large, connected, and strictly protected areas typically increased, were less variable from year to year, and suffered less from poaching. Conversely, populations in buffer areas that are less protected but still connected have more variation in growth from year to year. Buffer areas also differed more in their growth rates, likely due to more threats and dispersal opportunities in the face of such dangers. Isolated populations showed consistently high growth due to a lack of emigration. This suggests that “fortress” conservation generally maintains high growth, while anthropogenic-driven source-sink dynamics within connected conservation clusters drive stability in core areas and variability in buffers."

In a recent tragic incident, approximately 100 elephants in Africa perished due to inadequate access to water. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) issues a warning that around 2.5 billion people worldwide could face water scarcity by 2025. In the face of water shortages affecting not only human society but also the entire ecological community due to the climate crisis, it becomes crucial to adopt comprehensive measures for managing water quality and quantity to avert such pressing challenges.

A research team led by Professor Jonghun Kam and PhD candidate Kwang-Hun Lee from the Division of Environmental Science and Engineering at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), has implemented an advanced technique employing an uncrewed surface vehicle to concurrently assess the reservoir water depths and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations from the reservoir water surface. The findings from their research were featured in Water Resources Research, an international journal dedicated to the water environment.
Monitoring available water quantity and quality uses indicators such as water depth and nitrate concentration. Nitrates, originating from atmospheric and soil nutrients, enter streams through various pathways, posing a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity when their levels become excessive. Fluctuation of precipitation and water usage further impact water quality, and rising water temperatures contribute to decreased dissolved oxygen, resulting in diminished water quality.
Effective management of water resources requires the dual monitoring of nitrate concentration and water depth. However, these measurements can vary significantly based on the timing and location of assessment. Traditional water depth measurement, typically taken at a single point, introduces uncertainty in estimating the total reservoir water volume. In recent times, uncrewed devices or instruments have been introduced to address this challenge, yet simultaneous measurement of nitrate concentration and water depth has proven challenging.
The research team has achieved the simultaneous measurement of nitrate concentration and water depth using an uncrewed surface vehicle. Over the course of a year, starting in 2021, an uncrewed boat equipped with electrochemical sensors and acoustic doppler current profile sensors was employed to gauge nitrate concentration and water depth in a reservoir (Daljeonji) in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province in South Korea. The 30 measurements revealed seasonal variations with nitrate levels ranging from 1 ton to 4 tons. Following intense rainfall, the observed nitrate amount was up to 17% lower than previous readings due to rapid water expansion. This underscores the importance of considering timing and weather conditions in water quality assessments, as measurements may lead to over- or underestimation.
Furthermore, the team successfully generated a high-resolution map illustrating the cumulative nitrate content in Daljeonji Reservior based on data collected by the uncrewed surface vehicle. Despite a one-year measurement period and the study's confinement to Pohang, its significance lies in the independent development of technology capable of simultaneous measurement of nitrate concentration and water depth.
Professor Jonghun Kam who led the research explained, ""Our study has outlined both the possibilities and constraints of employing uncrewed robotics in water environment research."" He added, ""It is envisioned that this research will provide a guiding framework for the development of the next generation of the Korean national water resources management system, leveraging advanced technologies like uncrewed aerial vehicles to enhance prediction accuracy and optimize water management.""
The study was conducted with the support from the Group Research in Science and Engineering Program and the Ocean, Land, and Atmosphere Carbon Cycle System Research Program of the Ministry of Science and ICT and the National Research Foundation of Korea (2021M3I6A1086808).

Creating a functional lung using interspecies chimeric animals is an attractive albeit challenging option for lung transplantation, requiring more research on the viable conditions needed for organ generation. A new study uses reverse-blastocyst complementation and tetraploid-based organ complementation methods to first determine these conditions in lung-deficient mice and then to generate rat-derived lungs in these mice. It provides useful insights on the intrinsic species-specific barriers and factors associated with lung development in interspecies chimeric animals.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide. It is marked by lung damage that is lasting and incurable, leaving lung transplantation as the only viable treatment option. Unfortunately, finding suitable lung donors is difficult. To compensate for this shortage of donors, regenerative medicine is making strides in developing lungs from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), using interspecies animal models.
Through a biological technique known as blastocyst complementation, PSCs, and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from one species can be injected into blastocysts of a different organ-deficient species, creating interspecies chimeric animals. This technique has enabled successful regeneration of the pancreas, heart, and kidney in rat-mouse chimeras. However, functional lung formation has still not been achieved successfully, warranting further research into the viable conditions required to generate PSC-derived organs.
Now, scientists from Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Japan have used the reverse-blastocyst complementation (rBC) method to understand the conditions required to form lungs in rat-mouse chimeric models. In addition, they used the tetraploid-based organ complementation (TOC) method to successfully create a rat-derived lung in their mouse model. The study, published in Development, was led by Shunsuke Yuri and Ayako Isotani from NAIST.
The fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) and its interaction with the Fgf receptor 2 isoform IIIb (Fgfr2b) in the lungs are crucial for lung development. In this study, the rBC method involved injecting mutant ESCs which fail to show lung formation into wild-type (WT) embryos. This method allows for efficient detection of mutant PSCs in the recipient tissue, aiding the determination of the conditions necessary for successful lung formation in the organ-deficient animal.
The research team also found that WT ESCs provide uniform contributions across target and non-target organs in the chimeras. This helped ascertain that a certain number of WT or normal cells are required to overcome the lung development failure in Fgf10-deficient or Fgfr2b-deficient animals.
With this knowledge, they successfully produced rat-derived lungs in the Fgfr2b-deficient mouse embryos with the TOC method, without needing to produce a mutant mouse line. ""Interestingly, we found that the rat epithelial cells conserved intrinsic species-specific timing in the interspecies model, resulting in an underdeveloped lung,"" notes Yuri. Consequently, these lungs remained nonfunctional post-birth.
The findings of this study clearly identify the factors required and barriers to overcome for successful generation of functional lungs in rat-mouse interspecies chimeras. Speaking of the significance of these findings, Yuri concludes, ""We believe that our study makes an important contribution to the literature by presenting a faster and more efficient method of exploring blastocyst complementation. These novel results can significantly advance the progress toward developing in-vivo chimeric lungs for the purpose of transplantation, which could transform the practical application of regenerative medicine.""

Scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital are tackling Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) antibiotic resistance. This naturally antibiotic-resistant pathogen is becoming more prevalent, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutics. To address this, the scientists designed new versions of the drug spectinomycin that overcome efflux, the main mechanism driving resistance. The work was published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.

Mab infections are increasingly found in health care settings. Such infections can be hazardous for patients with compromised lung function, such as in cystic fibrosis, or who are immunologically compromised, such as in childhood cancer. These infections are treated with long courses of antibiotics and can result in poor outcomes. The emergence of Mab and other similar pathogens presents a growing and deeply concerning public health threat because there are few effective therapeutic options and a limited drug development pipeline.
""We chemists are in a race against the pathogens. We make stronger antibiotics, and the pathogens become more resistant,"" said corresponding author Richard Lee, PhD, St. Jude Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics.
Scientists at St. Jude modified the naturally occurring antibiotic spectinomycin to create analogs, comparable but structurally distinct N-ethylene linked aminomethyl spectinomycins (eAmSPCs). These synthetically created eAmSPCs are up to 64 times more potent against Mab than standard spectinomycin.
""By re-engineering the molecule through structure-based drug design, we and our collaborators have adapted the antibiotic to increase its activity,"" Lee added.
Overcoming efflux to make a more effective antibiotic
Through their work, the scientists unraveled the mechanism of action by which eAmSPCs are more effective: they circumvent efflux. Efflux is the process that cells use to get rid of a drug -- imagine pumping water out of a flooded basement -- and is a significant mechanism by which cells become resistant to therapy.

The N-ethylene linkage structure of the eAmSPCs plays a critical role in how the compounds avoid efflux, suggesting that longer linkages modify how the compound is pumped out of the cell. This ultimately shifts the balance toward higher concentrations of eAmSPC within the cell and thus enhances antimicrobial efficacy.
""Over the past two decades, we've seen a massive increase in the number of infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria like Mab,"" said co-first author Gregory Phelps, PharmD, St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. ""We had a place to start with this naturally occurring antibiotic, which, through modification, we've made much more efficacious against this clinically relevant pathogen.""
The researchers also found that eAmSPCs work well with various classes of antibiotics used to treat Mab and retain their activity against other mycobacterial strains. Collectively, this work demonstrates that eAmSPCs should be further studied and developed because once issues of tolerability and safety are addressed, these compounds could become next-generation therapeutics.
""It is challenging to attract pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotics for several economic reasons,"" said Phelps. ""If we can boost the drug pipeline against this hard-to-treat bacteria, we can potentially make a difference for patients like the ones we have here at St. Jude who are increasingly faced with limited or no therapeutic options.""

Current standard-of-care therapy results in poor outcomes, demonstrating the urgent need to develop effective antimycobacterial regimens. Through synthetic modification of spectinomycin (SPC), we have identified a distinct structural subclass of N-ethylene linked aminomethyl SPCs (eAmSPCs) that are up to 64-fold more potent against Mab over the parent SPC. Mechanism of action and crystallography studies demonstrate that the eAmSPCs display a mode of ribosomal inhibition consistent with SPC. However, they exert their increased antimicrobial activity through enhanced accumulation, largely by circumventing efflux mechanisms. The N-ethylene linkage within this series plays a critical role in avoiding TetV-mediated efflux, as lead eAmSPC 2593 displays a mere fourfold susceptibility improvement against Mab Δ tetV, in contrast to the 64-fold increase for SPC. Even a minor shortening of the linkage by a single carbon, akin to 1st generation AmSPC 1950, results in a substantial increase in MICs and a 16-fold rise in susceptibility against Mab Δ tetV . These shifts suggest that longer linkages might modify the kinetics of drug expulsion by TetV, ultimately shifting the equilibrium towards heightened intracellular concentrations and enhanced antimicrobial efficacy. Furthermore, lead eAmSPCs were also shown to synergize with various classes of anti- Mab antibiotics and retain activity against clinical isolates and other mycobacterial strains. Encouraging pharmacokinetic profiles coupled with robust efficacy in Mab murine infection models suggest that eAmSPCs hold the potential to be developed into treatments for Mab and other NTM infections."

With a split-second muscle contraction, the greater blue-ringed octopus can change the size and color of the namesake patterns on its skin for purposes of deception, camouflage and signaling. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine have drawn inspiration from this natural wonder to develop a technological platform with similar capabilities for use in a variety of fields, including the military, medicine, robotics and sustainable energy.

According to its inventors, new devices made possible by this innovation will benefit from dynamically adjustable fluorescent and spectroscopic properties, ease of manufacturing, and potential for scaling to areas large enough to cover vehicles, billboards and even buildings. The bio-inspired creation is the subject of a study published recently in Nature Communications.
Hapalochlaena lunulata is a species of octopus native to the Western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. It uses a neurotoxin venom to stun its prey and can ward off predators with a flash of its blue rings. These iridescent circles on a brown background on the creature's skin are what drew the attention of the UCI researchers.
""We are fascinated by the mechanisms underpinning the blue-ringed octopus' ability to rapidly switch its skin markings between hidden and exposed states,"" said senior co-author Alon Gorodetsky, UCI professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering. ""For this project, we worked to mimic the octopus' natural abilities with devices from unique materials we synthesized in our laboratory, and the result is an octopus-inspired deception and signaling system that is straightforward to fabricate, functions for a long time when operated continuously, and can even repair itself when damaged.""
The architecture of the innovation calls for a thin film consisting of wrinkled blue rings surrounding brown circles -- much like those on the octopus -- sandwiched between a topmost transparent proton-conducting electrode and an underlying acrylic membrane, with another identical electrode underneath.
Further technical creativity by the researchers occurs at the molecular level as they explored the use of acenes, which are organic compounds made up of linearly fused benzene rings. Designer nonacene-like molecules (with nine linearly fused rings) used by the team help give the platform some of its outstanding capabilities, according to Gorodetsky.
""For our devices, we conceptualized and designed a nonacene-like molecule with a unique architecture,"" said co-lead author Preeta Pratakshya, who recently received her Ph.D. in UCI's Department of Chemistry. ""Acenes are organic hydrocarbon molecules with a host of advantageous characteristics, including ease of synthesis, tunable electronic characteristics, and controllable optical properties.""
She added, ""Our nonacene-like molecules are exceptional among acenes because they can survive years of storage in air and over a day of continuous irradiation with bright light in air. No other expanded acene displays this combined long-term stability under such harsh conditions.""

According to Gorodetsky, the type of molecules used to fabricate the colored blue ring layer are what endow the devices with their most favorable features, including adjustable spectroscopic properties, the facilitation of straightforward benchtop manufacturing and ambient-atmosphere stability under illumination.
""Our co-author Sahar Sharifzadeh, a Boston University professor of electrical and computer engineering, demonstrated that the stimuli-responsive properties of the molecules can be computationally predicted, which opens paths for the in silico design of other camouflage technologies,"" Gorodetsky said.
In their laboratory tests, many of which happened in UCI's California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, the team found that the bioinspired devices could change their visible appearance over 500 times with little or no degradation, and they also could autonomously self-repair without user intervention.
The invention was demonstrated to possess a desirable combination of capabilities in the ultraviolet, visible light, and near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, according to Gorodetsky. This would enable the devices to disguise other objects from detection or to clandestinely signal observers.
""The photophysical robustness and general processability of our nonacene-like molecule -- and presumably its variants -- opens opportunities for future investigation of these compounds within the context of traditional optoelectronic systems such as light-emitting diodes and solar cells,"" added Gorodetsky.
Joining Gorodetsky and Pratakshya in this study were Chengyi Xu, Panyiming Liu, Reina Kurakake, and Robert Lopez in UCI's Department of Materials Science and Engineering; David Josh Dibble and Anthony Burke in UCI's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering; Philip Denison in UCI's Department of Chemistry; and Aliya Mukazhanova and Sharifzadeh of Boston University.

Animals reproduce in one of two distinct ways: egg-laying or live birth. By studying an evolutionarily recent transition from egg-laying to live-bearing in a marine snail, collaborative research by the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), the University of Sheffield, and the University of Gothenburg has shed new light on the genetic changes that allow organisms to make the switch. The results were published in Science.

The egg did come first. Egg-laying arose deep in evolutionary time, long before animals even made their way onto land. Throughout evolution, there have been many independent transitions to live-bearing across the animal kingdom, including insects, fish, reptiles, and mammals. Yet, these examples have taught us very little about the number of genetic changes it takes to go from eggs to live offspring.
Now, an international team of researchers led by ISTA postdoc Sean Stankowski has used a humble marine snail to reveal the genetic changes that underpin the transition to live-bearing. The main advantage of investigating this phenomenon in marine snails: Live-bearing evolved within the past 100,000 years in these organisms -- a blink of an eye in evolutionary terms. Thus, these marine snails could provide a unique chance to reveal the genetic basis of live-bearing. ""Almost all mammals give live birth, and this function has accompanied their evolution for around 140 million years. Yet, in this study, we can investigate how live-bearing evolved completely independently, and much more recently, in marine snails,"" says Stankowski. The team's central finding: the switch to live-bearing is caused by around 50 genetic changes that are scattered around the snail genome.
One species, over a hundred names
The seaside marine snail Littorina saxatilis is the most misidentified creature in the world, The Guardian reported in 2015. Over centuries, scientists have described it as a new species or subspecies more than a hundred times, despite it being commonly found throughout the North Atlantic shores. This whole confusion must have stemmed from this species' many shell variations and habitats. On top of this, L. saxatilis has a unique reproductive mode: it has evolved live-bearing while related marine snails that share its habitat lay eggs. ""Scientists have mainly studied shell variation within L. saxatilis rather than what differentiates the species from its egg-laying relatives. The reality is that this snail species is the odd one out when it comes to its breeding strategy,"" says Stankowski.
Losing the egg, one step at a time
An eye-opening moment was when Stankowski inferred the phylogenetic tree, or evolutionary ""family tree,"" of L. saxatilis and other related, egg-laying Littorina species, using whole-genome sequences. He showed that, although live-bearing is the only trait that distinguishes L. saxatilis from its egg-laying relatives, L. saxatilis did not seem to form a single evolutionary group. It was this mismatch between reproductive strategy and ancestry that ultimately allowed Stankowski and his collaborators to disentangle the genetic basis of live-bearing from other genetic changes throughout the snail genome. ""We were able to identify 50 genomic regions that together seem to determine whether individuals lay eggs or give birth to live young,"" says Stankowski. ""We don't know exactly what each region does, but we were able to link many of them to reproductive differences by comparing patterns of gene expression in egg-laying and live-bearing snails."" Overall, the results suggest that live-bearing evolved gradually through the accumulation of many mutations that arose over the last 100,000 years.

The costs and benefits of live-bearing
The research shows that the switch to live-bearing allowed snails to spread into new areas and habitats where egg-layers cannot survive and reproduce. But the precise benefits of live-bearing in these snails remain a mystery. ""We don't know for sure, but the transition from egg-laying to live-bearing may have arisen by natural selection favoring increased egg retention time, with the eggs eventually hatching inside the mother. We speculate that eggs might have been more susceptible to drying out, physical damage, and predators,"" says Stankowski. In live-bearers, offspring are protected from the elements until they can fend for themselves, he adds. But by solving one problem, live-bearing would have certainly created others. ""The extra investment in offspring would have almost certainly placed new demands on the snails' anatomy, physiology, and immune system. It's likely that many of the genomic regions we identified are involved in responding to these types of challenges.""
Mapping the function of each gene
Although the work sheds new light on the transition from eggs to live offspring, many questions remain to be answered. ""Most genetic innovations are in fact really old and tangled up on an evolutionary scale which makes it difficult to study their origin,"" says Stankowski. ""These snails have allowed us to do exactly that, but we have only begun to scratch the surface of what they can teach us about the origins of novelty."" As a next step, the researchers want to map the function of each mutation. ""We aim to understand how each genetic change shaped the snails' form and function on the way to live-bearing, step by step,"" concludes Stankowski.

A recent transition from egg-laying to live-bearing in marine snails ( Littorina spp.) provides the opportunity to study the genetic architecture of an innovation that has evolved repeatedly across animals. Individuals do not cluster by reproductive mode in a genome-wide phylogeny, but local genealogical analysis revealed numerous small genomic regions where all live-bearers carry the same core haplotype. Candidate regions show evidence for live-bearer–specific positive selection and are enriched for genes that are differentially expressed between egg-laying and live-bearing reproductive systems. Ages of selective sweeps suggest that live-bearer–specific alleles accumulated over more than 200,000 generations. Our results suggest that new functions evolve through the recruitment of many alleles rather than in a single evolutionary step."

Breakthrough could dramatically cut the use of pesticides and unlock other opportunities to bolster plant health

Scientists have engineered the microbiome of plants for the first time, boosting the prevalence of 'good' bacteria that protect the plant from disease.
The findings published in Nature Communications by researchers from the University of Southampton, China and Austria, could substantially reduce the need for environmentally destructive pesticides.
There is growing public awareness about the significance of our microbiome -- the myriad of microorganisms that live in and around our bodies, most notably in our guts. Our gut microbiomes influence our metabolism, our likelihood of getting ill, our immune system, and even our mood.
Plants too host a huge variety of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other microorganisms that live in their roots, stems, and leaves. For the past decade, scientists have been intensively researching plant microbiomes to understand how they affect a plant's health and its vulnerability to disease.
""For the first time, we've been able to change the makeup of a plant's microbiome in a targeted way, boosting the numbers of beneficial bacteria that can protect the plant from other, harmful bacteria,"" says Dr Tomislav Cernava, co-author of the paper and Associate Professor in Plant-Microbe Interactions at the University of Southampton.
""This breakthrough could reduce reliance on pesticides, which are harmful to the environment. We've achieved this in rice crops, but the framework we've created could be applied to other plants and unlock other opportunities to improve their microbiome. For example, microbes that increase nutrient provision to crops could reduce the need for synthetic fertilisers.""
The international research team discovered that one specific gene found in the lignin biosynthesis cluster of the rice plant is involved in shaping its microbiome. Lignin is a complex polymer found in the cell walls of plants -- the biomass of some plant species consists of more than 30 per cent lignin.

First, the researchers observed that when this gene was deactivated, there was a decrease in the population of certain beneficial bacteria, confirming its importance in the makeup of the microbiome community.
The researchers then did the opposite, over-expressing the gene so it produced more of one specific type of metabolite -- a small molecule produced by the host plant during its metabolic processes. This increased the proportion of beneficial bacteria in the plant microbiome.
When these engineered plants were exposed to Xanthomonas oryzae -- a pathogen that causes bacterial blight in rice crops, they were substantially more resistant to it than wild-type rice.
Bacterial blight is common in Asia and can lead to substantial loss of rice yields. It's usually controlled by deploying polluting pesticides, so producing a crop with a protective microbiome could help bolster food security and help the environment.
The research team are now exploring how they can influence the presence of other beneficial microbes to unlock various plant health benefits.

However, the underlying mechanisms of host-driven assembly of these ubiquitous communities remain largely elusive. Here, we conduct a large-scale and in-depth assessment of the rice phyllosphere microbiome aimed at identifying specific host-microbe links. A genome-wide association study reveals a strong association between the plant genotype and members of four bacterial orders, Pseudomonadales, Burkholderiales, Enterobacterales and Xanthomonadales. Some of the associations are specific to a distinct host genomic locus, pathway or even gene. The compound 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4-HCA) is identified as the main driver for enrichment of bacteria belonging to Pseudomonadales. 4-HCA can be synthesized by the host plant’s OsPAL02 from the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. A knockout mutant of OsPAL02 results in reduced Pseudomonadales abundance, dysbiosis of the phyllosphere microbiota and consequently higher susceptibility of rice plants to disease. Our study provides a direct link between a specific plant metabolite and rice phyllosphere homeostasis opening possibilities for new breeding strategies."

A decades-old mystery of how natural antimicrobial predatory bacteria are able to recognize and kill other bacteria may have been solved, according to new research.

In a study published today (4th January) in Nature Microbiology, researchers from the University of Birmingham and the University of Nottingham have discovered how natural antimicrobial predatory bacteria, called Bdellovibrio bacterivorous, produce fibre-like proteins on their surface to ensnare prey.
This discovery may enable scientists to use these predators to target and kill problematic bacteria that cause issues in healthcare, food spoilage and the environment.
Professor of Structural Biology at the University of Birmingham, Andrew Lovering said: ""Since the 1960s Bdellovibrio bacterivorous has been known to hunt and kill other bacteria by entering the target cells and eating them from the inside before later bursting out. The question that had stumped scientists was 'how do these cells make a firm attachment when we know how varied their bacterial targets are?'""
Professor Lovering and Professor Liz Sockett, from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham, have been collaborating in this field for almost 15 years. The breakthrough came when Sam Greenwood an undergraduate student, and Asmaa Al-Bayati, a PhD student in the Sockett lab, discovered that the Bdellovibrio predators lay down a sturdy vesicle (a ""pinched-off"" part of the predator cell envelope) when invading their prey.
Professor Liz Sockett explained: ""The vesicle creates a kind of airlock or keyhole allowing Bdellovibrio entry into the prey cell. We were then able to isolate this vesicle from the dead prey, which is a first in this field. The vesicle was analysed to reveal the tools used during the preceding event of predator/prey contact. We thought of it as a bit like a locksmith leaving the pick, or key, as evidence, in the keyhole.
""By looking at the vesicle contents, we discovered that because Bdellovibrio doesn't know which bacteria it will meet, it deploys a range of similar prey recognition molecules on its surface, creating lots of different 'keys' to 'unlock' lots of different types of prey.""
The researchers then undertook an individual analysis of the molecules, demonstrating that they form long fibres, approximately ten times longer than common globular proteins. This allows them to operate at a distance and ""feel"" for prey in the vicinity.

In total, the labs counted 21 different fibres. Researchers Dr Simon Caulton, Dr Carey Lambert and Dr Jess Tyson worked on how they operated both at the cellular and molecular level. They were supported by fibre gene-engineering by Paul Radford and Rob Till. The team then began to attempt linking a particular fibre to a particular prey-surface molecule. Finding out which fibre matches which prey, could enable an engineering approach which sees bespoke predators targeting different types of bacteria.
Professor Lovering continued: ""Because the predator strain we were looking at comes from the soil it has a wide killing range, making this identification of these fibre and prey pairs very difficult. However, on the fifth attempt to find the partners we discovered a chemical signature on the outside of prey bacteria that was a tight fit to the fibre tip. This is the first time a feature of Bdellovibrio has been matched to prey selection.""
Scientists in this field will now be able to use these discoveries to ask which fibre set is used by the different predators they study and potentially attribute these to specific prey. Improving understanding of these predator bacteria could enable their usage as antibiotics, to kill bacteria that degrade food, or ones which are harmful to the environment.
Professor Lovering concluded: ""We know that these bacteria can be helpful, and by fully understanding how they operate and find their prey, it opens up a world of new discoveries and possibilities.""
The research was funded by the Wellcome Trust Investigator in Science Award (209437/Z/17/Z).

The mechanisms underlying prey recognition and handling remain obscure. Here we use complementary genetic, microscopic and structural methods to address this deficit. During invasion, the B. bacteriovorus protein CpoB concentrates into a vesicular compartment that is deposited into the prey periplasm. Proteomic and structural analyses of vesicle contents reveal several fibre-like proteins, which we name the mosaic adhesive trimer (MAT) superfamily, and show localization on the predator surface before prey encounter. These dynamic proteins indicate a variety of binding capabilities, and we confirm that one MAT member shows specificity for surface glycans from a particular prey. Our study shows that the B. bacteriovorus MAT protein repertoire enables a broad means for the recognition and handling of diverse prey epitopes encountered during bacterial predation and invasion."

Honey yields in the U.S. have been declining since the 1990s, with honey producers and scientists unsure why, but a new study by Penn State researchers has uncovered clues in the mystery of the missing honey.

Using five decades of data from across the U.S., the researchers analyzed the potential factors and mechanisms that might be affecting the number of flowers growing in different regions -- and, by extension, the amount of honey produced by honey bees.
The study, recently published in the journal Environmental Research, found that changes in honey yields over time were connected to herbicide application and land use, such as fewer land conservation programs that support pollinators. Annual weather anomalies also contributed to changes in yields.
The data, pulled from several open-source databases including those operated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service and USDA Farm Service Agency, included such information as average honey yield per honey bee colony, land use, herbicide use, climate, weather anomalies and soil productivity in the continental United States.
Overall, researchers found that climate conditions and soil productivity -- the ability of soil to support crops based on its physical, chemical and biological properties -- were some of the most important factors in estimating honey yields. States in both warm and cool regions produced higher honey yields when they had productive soils.
The eco-regional soil and climate conditions set the baseline levels of honey production, while changes in land use, herbicide use and weather influenced how much is produced in a given year, the researchers summarized.
Gabriela Quinlan, the lead author on the study and a National Science Foundation (NSF) postdoctoral research fellow in Penn State's Department of Entomology and Center for Pollinator Research, said she was inspired to conduct the study after attending beekeeper meetings and conferences and repeatedly hearing the same comment: You just can't make honey like you used to.

According to Quinlan, climate became increasingly tied to honey yields in the data after 1992.
""It's unclear how climate change will continue to affect honey production, but our findings may help to predict these changes,"" Quinlan said. ""For example, pollinator resources may decline in the Great Plains as the climate warms and becomes more moderate, while resources may increase in the mid-Atlantic as conditions become hotter.""
Co-author on the paper Christina Grozinger, Publius Vergilius Maro Professor of Entomology and director of the Center for Pollinator Research, said that while scientists previously knew that many factors influence flowering plant abundance and flower production, prior studies were conducted in only one region of the U.S.
""What's really unique about this study is that we were able to take advantage of 50 years of data from across the continental U.S.,"" she said. ""This allowed us to really investigate the role of soil, eco-regional climate conditions, annual weather variation, land use and land management practices on the availability of nectar for honey bees and other pollinators.""
One of the biggest stressors to pollinators is a lack of flowers to provide enough pollen and nectar for food, according to the researchers. Because different regions can support different flowering plants depending on climate and soil characteristics, they said there is growing interest in identifying regions and landscapes with enough flowers to make them bee friendly.
""A lot of factors affect honey production, but a main one is the availability of flowers,"" she said. ""Honey bees are really good foragers, collecting nectar from a variety of flowering plants and turning that nectar into honey. I was curious that if beekeepers are seeing less honey, does that mean there are fewer floral resources available to pollinators overall? And if so, what environmental factors were causing this change?""
For Quinlan, one of the most exciting findings was the importance of soil productivity, which she said is an under-explored factor in analyzing how suitable different landscapes are for pollinators. While many studies have examined the importance of nutrients in the soil, less work has been done on how soil characteristics like temperature, texture, structure -- properties that help determine productivity -- affect pollinator resources.

The researchers also found that decreases in soybean land and increases in Conservation Reserve Program land, a national conservation program that has been shown to support pollinators, both resulted in positive effects on honey yields.
Herbicide application rates were also important in predicting honey yields, potentially because removing flowering weeds can reduce nutritional sources available to bees.
""Our findings provide valuable insights that can be applied to improve models and design experiments to enable beekeepers to predict honey yields, growers to understand pollination services, and land managers to support plant-pollinator communities and ecosystem services,"" Quinlan said.

Managed honey bees, as generalist foragers that hoard nectar as honey, can act as bioindicators of floral resources available to pollinators in a given landscape through their accumulation of honey. Honey yields across the United States have decreased appreciably since the 1990s, concurrent with shifts in climate, land-use, and large-scale pesticide application. While many factors can affect honey accumulation, this suggests that anthropogenic stressors may be having large-scale impacts on the floral resources that pollinators depend on for their nutrition. We used hierarchical partitioning on five decades of state-level data to parse the most important environmental factors and likely mechanisms associated with spatial and temporal variation in honey yields across the US. Climatic conditions and soil productivity were among the most important variables for estimating honey yields, with states in warm or cool regions with productive soils having the highest honey yields per colony. These findings suggest that foundational factors constrain pollinator habitat suitability and define ecoregions of low or high honey production. The most important temporally varying factors were change in herbicide use, land use (i.e. increase in intensive agriculture and reduction in land conservation programs that support pollinators) and annual weather anomalies. This study provides insights into the interplay between broad abiotic conditions and fine temporal variation on habitat suitability for honey bees and other pollinators. Our results also provide a baseline for investigating how these factors influence floral resource availability, which is essential to developing strategies for resilient plant–pollinator communities in the face of global change."

As one of the top predators roaming Antarctica, the sizeable southern elephant seal has its fair selection of the menu. But it turns out they don't just want to eat anything and everything.

According to new research led by UNSW Sydney, male southern elephant seals have their own favourite foods, and they like to stick with them. In other words, they're very fussy eaters.
""They could have the pick of the buffet, and yet each male southern elephant seal eats a lot of the same food, which is just a fraction of what's on offer,"" says Andrea Cormack, lead author of the study and a PhD candidate at UNSW Science. ""So, they are extremely picky eaters, each with their own unique favourite foods they go after, whether it be fish, squid species, crustaceans or octopus.""
The research, published in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series, is one of the first studies to analyse the diet of adult male southern elephant seals, who, despite their impressive size, are relatively understudied compared to females.
""We didn't specifically compare males to females in this study,"" Ms Cormack says. ""But females are known to maintain a fairly specialised diet between one another, just nowhere near as extreme as what we found with the males in our research.""
Unlocking chemical clues from whiskers
Getting close enough to study the diet of male elephant seals in the wild can be challenging, given their powerful stature and aggressive temperament -- they can weigh up to four tonnes, dwarfing their more placid, smaller female counterparts. Instead, researchers analyse the composition of smaller hard tissues back in the lab that keep more detailed records of the animal's activity.

For the study, the scientists inferred the eating habits of 31 male southern elephant seals from the Western Antarctic Peninsula by analysing a whisker sample from each seal that holds stable isotopes -- chemical clues about the food they've eaten in the past. Each whisker analysed in the study contained up to a year's worth of data about each seal's culinary preferences, allowing the team to assemble the most extensive picture of the male southern elephant seal diet to date.
""These guys are out in the water foraging for months, and then fasting for two to three months on land during breeding season, so it's hard to gather a lot of information about their diet through study methods like stomach analysis,"" Ms Cormack says. ""But by analysing hard tissues that store an inert chemical record of what they've eaten, we can start putting together the pieces about their eating habits.""
The researchers found nearly all male southern elephant seals are specialists, with individuals consistently eating the same food items over time with little variation in diet. Most of those could be considered extreme specialists, feeding on less than 20 per cent of their population's range of food types. Meanwhile, only one seal in the sample was a generalist and chose to eat a broad diet of various food sources.
""The Antarctic ecosystem has a lot of variety, but male southern elephant seals don't like to mix it up,"" says Professor Tracey Rogers, a marine ecologist at UNSW Science and senior author of the study. ""They each have their own favourite foods, and they stick to them despite all the options available.""
Speculation over specialisation
The study found variation between individuals strongly correlated with their body size. The heaviest seals ate further up the trophic scale, or food chain. In other words, they ate larger energy-dense prey, such as big squid, leading up to the breeding season.

But it wasn't the size of the seal that determined specialisation. Even seals on the smaller end that fed further down the trophic scale on smaller fish were extreme specialists from early adult life.
""They were all consistently picky on their food type regardless of size,"" Ms Cormack says. ""For these guys, who can lose up to 50 per cent of their body weight during the breeding season when they're fasting on land, what you choose to eat could be very important.""
The researchers don't know the exact cause of the male's picky eating habits but suspect it could be for many reasons including gape size, which may dictate ideal prey size and feeding technique, to fluctuations in seasonal and yearly food availability.
Specialisation could also have several ramifications. Concentrating on different, but very particular food types -- even a subpar option- could help improve foraging success rates between male seals and allow them to gain the size needed to compete with other males for breeding rights.
""We know from previous studies that individuals will often return each year to the same feeding grounds in search of their favourite foods,"" Ms Cormack says. ""But we need more studies to be confident about exactly what's driving specialisation and how it impacts breeding success.""
The looming climate change threat
Thanks to conservation efforts, the southern elephant seal population has bounced back after being hunted to near extinction and is no longer considered endangered. However, the risk of a new decline looms from the impact of climate change.
For example, climate-driven shifts in the Southern Ocean can change krill availability, which impacts the seal's ability to feed on its favourite foods further up the food chain. Furthermore, emerging pathogens like deadly avian flu strains also threaten to wipe out populations.
""The Western Antarctic Peninsula, where these incredible animals live, is one of the areas experiencing the greatest changes from ocean warming,"" Prof. Rogers says. ""The ice cliffs are almost completely gone, and the periods where new ice forms are getting shorter, changing the whole ecosystem. This could be problematic, with climate change affecting food resource availability across the Southern Ocean, which is why we need more research.""
Future work would also benefit from increasing the sample size to make the analysis more robust, looking at groups of male southern elephant seals from other colonies around the Southern Ocean, and more satellite tracking to improve our understanding of the seal's dietary specialisation.
""We've established a solid foundation of evidence about how the individual diets of male southern elephant seals vary,"" Ms Cormack says. ""It would be great to do more longitudinal-type studies to continue building our knowledge of male southern elephant seal specialisation and its impacts.""

Individual males can vary morphologically as well as behaviourally, leading to differences in their life history trajectories and outcomes. Therefore, to improve our understanding of the male diet, we sought to determine the degree of dietary variation between as well as within individuals from the West Antarctic Peninsula. Secondly, we investigated whether individual morphological traits, seasonality, and year influenced their dietary variation. Whiskers were sampled from 31 adult male seals and used to measure the bulk stable isotope nitrogen (δ15N). We sequentially segmented each whisker to create a time series of datapoints for each individual, allowing us to compare δ15N variation within each seal as well as assess variation between the seals. We then investigated the relationships between male dietary variation and body length, girth, season, and year. We found that adult male SESs maintained an extremely specialised diet. Variation between individuals was strongly correlated with their body size, with larger seals feeding higher up the trophic web. Interestingly, seasonality and year both influenced variation within the seals’ diets, but only year was seen to influence the variability between seals. We discuss the possible causes and ramifications of dietary specialisation for the SES and highlight the need for combined tracking and stable isotope investigations to improve our understanding of the ontogeny of the seals’ dietary specialisation."

We have two copies of each chromosome in every cell in our bodies except in our reproductive cells. Sperm and egg cells contain a single copy of each chromosome with a unique mix of genes from our parents, an evolutionary trick to give our offspring genetic variability. The sperm and egg are made during meiosis, the process by which cells with two chromosome copies reduce their chromosome numbers to one. For meiosis to work, the two chromosomes must align perfectly and exchange the correct amount of genetic information. Any deviation puts fertility at risk.

Enter the synaptonemal complex (SC), a zipper-like protein structure that lines up and anchors the two parental chromosomes together, end-to-end, to facilitate successful genetic exchanges. Failure to regulate this exchange is a leading cause of age-related infertility in humans and could compromise fertility across the tree of life. Humans, fungi, plants, worms and anything that reproduces sexually uses the SC to make reproductive cells, known as gametes. Despite its importance, we don't understand how proteins within the SC regulate chromosomal interactions because this multi-step process happens in internal organs and has been impossible to recreate in a lab.
In a new study, University of Utah biologists developed a method for illuminating the intricate interactions of the SC in the nematode C. elegans. The authors identified a trio of protein segments that guide chromosomal interactions, and pinpointed the location where they interact with each other. Their novel method uses a technique known as genetic suppressor screening, which can serve as a blueprint for research on large cellular assemblies that resist traditional structural analysis.
""This is a way to lock in on systems in cells that are too 'loosie-goosey' to use methods that rely on crystallization,"" said Ofer Rog, associate professor of biology at the U and senior author of the study. ""A lot of the interactions in cells are loosely bonded together. The problem is that you can't look at it under an electron microscope because nothing is stable enough -- everything is constantly moving. Our approach allows you to study even the interactions that are relatively weak or transient.""
The study published on Dec. 6, 2023, in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
The birds and the bees… and the nematodes
Let's dig into meiosis. Chromosomes are thread-like structures made of DNA that carry genetic information when cells divide and from generation to generation. Regular cells have a certain number of chromosomes; humans have 46 and C. elegans have 12. Chromosomes come in pairs called homologous chromosomes that carry the genes we inherited from each of our parents -- one from our mom, one from our dad. When meiosis begins, homologous chromosomes arrange themselves into elongated structures organized along a backbone called the axis. The axes of homologous pairs are aligned lengthwise to each other while at the same time, the synaptonemal complex (SC) forms between the parallel axes. The homologous pairs have matching genes arranged in the same order, with small variations within the genes -- these are the variations that make each individual unique.

""You can think of it like a zipper,"" Rog explained. ""The axes of the chromosomes are like the two sides of your shirt. The synaptonemal complex is kind of like the teeth of the zippers that lock onto each other and can pull and align the two sides of the shirt correctly.""
Scientist previously knew that the SC of C. elegans formed between homologs, but the U biologists are the first to pinpoint the exact position where the SC interacts with itself to facilitate genetic exchanges.
""When you exchange information between the chromosomes, you want to make sure that at the end you still have two complete chromosomes,"" said Rog. ""The way the cell does it is that the two chromosomes are perfectly aligned. So, when you exchange segments between them, you're not losing any information in the process.
How to analyze loosie-goosey structures
The researchers bred 50,000 nematodes that had temperature-sensitive defects in the SC. At high temperatures, the worms were unable to form the SC protein zipper needed to join the chromosomes together. Without the zipper, the gene exchanges during meiosis either didn't happen at all or didn't occur at the right number. Lisa Kursel, postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study ran the experiments.
""We grew the worms at the permissive, cooler temperature, then exposed them to a chemical that caused millions of mutations along their chromosomes and watched to see if any of the mutated worms could reproduce at the warmer temperature,"" Kursel said. The chemically induced mutations that corrected the nematode's infertility are known as suppressor mutations. ""Then we'd know if the suppressor mutations restored their fertility.""
To identify the animals with mutations that made them fertile again, the researchers put the nematodes on agar plates filled with yummy bacteria. The agar plates that had fertile nematodes were soon empty as their progeny ate the food. The agar plates with sterile worms died off before they could clean their plate, allowing the bacteria to flourish.

Once they had fertile nematodes, they could test if the mutation ""fixed"" the protein zipper. They then screened every single base pair on the DNA -- 100 million base pairs -- and identified which mutations restored the worms' ability to reproduce. They found that all the helpful mutations occurred in short segments of three proteins, SYP-1, SYP-3, SYP-4. Moreover, the mutations carried distinct signatures of interaction. For example, while the original mutations changed the electric charge from positive to negative, the helpful mutations flipped the charge back.
""This was a strong indication that SYP-1, SYP-3 and SYP-4 interact with each other like magnets, with positive and negative regions attracted to each other,"" said Rog. Such ""sticky"" interactions could also help tether the chromosomes together.
Jesus Aguayo Martinez, a senior biology major and co-author of the study, looked at the behavior of the suppressor mutation in nematodes without the original SC-disrupting mutation.
""We thought that since the original mutation alone produced a fertility defect, then the nematodes with the suppressor mutation alone would also have a fertility defect. That wasn't the case,"" said Aguayo Martinez. ""Surprisingly, normal worms and worms with only the suppressor mutations produced similar numbers of progeny.""
Next steps
Uncovering the SC's role in meiosis may help to better understand fertility in humans. The SC has a similar role across all eukaryotes, from nematodes to fungi to plants to humans. Previous research by the Rog Lab at the U showed that the structure itself looks the same and acts similarly to bring in parental chromosomes to facilitate exchanges. However, the actual sequences of the protein components are different between organisms. Such a pattern is unusual: Most cellular structures that carry essential, basic functions like cell division, genome duplication or metabolism are highly conserved, and could in fact be swapped between different organisms.
""A question that we think a lot about is what is special about the SC? Why can it do the same thing and look the same way, but consist of different building blocks?"" Rog asked.
Kursel, Aguayo Martinez, Rog and other members of the lab are doing more analysis on the evolution of the SC across species, and of other cellular structures that defy the common wisdom of evolution.

During meiosis, chromosomes are aligned end-to-end by an interface called the synaptonemal complex, which also regulates exchanges between them. However, despite the functional and ultrastructural conservation of this essential interface, how protein–protein interactions within the synaptonemal complex regulate chromosomal interactions remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a genetic interaction in the C. elegans synaptonemal complex, comprised of short segments of three proteins, SYP-1, SYP-3, and SYP-4. We identified the interaction through a saturated suppressor screen of a mutant that destabilizes the synaptonemal complex. The specificity and tight distribution of suppressors suggest a charge-based interface that promotes interactions between synaptonemal complex subunits and, in turn, allows intimate interactions between chromosomes.

The Santa Barbara Channel's kelp forests and its sandy beaches are intimately connected. Giant kelp, the foundation species of rocky reefs, serves as a major part of the beach food web as fronds of the giant seaweed break away from the forest and are transported to the beach. But the relationship goes deeper.

In a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team of scientists demonstrated that kelp forests can do more than supply food to tiny, hungry crustaceans living in the sand. They can also influence the dynamics of the sandy beach food web.
""The amount of kelp on the reef changes through time in a way where the peaks and low points in abundance across several kelp forests are matched together,"" said lead author Jonathan Walter, a senior researcher at the University of California, Davis, and its Center for Watershed Sciences. ""That's what we refer to as synchrony. It is related to the ability of systems to persist in the face of changing environmental conditions. A little asynchrony allows systems to be resistant to fluctuations and therefore more stable.""
The study uncovers the role of synchrony in the beach food web, with broader implications as the climate shifts in ways that might change how linked ecosystems perform their functions.
Revealing synchrony's role in these ecosystems fills a key knowledge gap in our understanding of the connection of reef and beach.
""The kelp forest and the beach are both highly dynamic ecosystems,"" said co-author Jenny Dugan, a coastal marine ecologist at UC Santa Barbara. ""How the dynamics of those two ecosystems interact and behave is the key question here, especially with the beach system so dependent on the kelp forest.""
In sync
Though a natural and ubiquitous phenomenon, synchrony and its implications are not yet fully understood.

The research team sought to understand whether and how kelp wrack (detritus) could affect the beach ecosystem's dynamics. For instance, how might species respond to the changing environment, and how resilient is the beach ecosystem to disturbances?
To address these questions, the study used long-term data from UCSB's Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research site, which is supported by the National Science Foundation. The team's model was built on a time series of wind, wave, wrack, and beach-width data at five sandy beaches over 11 years.
It revealed patterns of synchrony -- where the abundance of kelp wrack on beaches could be explained by kelp abundance in the forest, wave action, and beach width fluctuating together. At the longest timescales, kelp forest biomass and beach width were the biggest drivers of kelp wrack on the beaches.
Beach melodies
""We found time lags in this synchrony that were important,"" Dugan said. ""It wasn't as simple as everything changing at the same time -- it was like separate songs or melodies that came together in different ways. This made the patterns more complex, which is why it required the type of analyses we used.""
Importantly, the researchers found this synchrony crossed from ocean to shore. The abundance of predatory shorebirds, like sandpipers and plovers, lagged behind the deposition of wrack on beaches.

""Once on the beach, kelp wrack feeds a highly productive community of small invertebrates -- crustaceans and insects -- that are in turn a favorite food of shorebirds,"" Dugan explained. The cross-system synchrony is particularly notable because the beach ecosystem relies so heavily on kelp subsidies, she added.
Dynamic nature
""The dynamic nature of kelp forests, in terms of their high productivity and turnover, is unique for ecosystems structured around foundation species,"" said co-author and coastal ecologist Kyle Emery, a researcher in the UCSB Marine Science Institute. ""It allows us to observe change many times over compared to other foundation species and gives us the ability to observe many different system states, processes and functions. This enabled us to more rapidly analyze these questions of cross-ecosystem synchrony.""

Subsidies are indicative of processes connecting ecosystems and can couple ecological dynamics across system boundaries. However, the degree to which such flows can induce cross-ecosystem cascades of spatial synchrony, the tendency for system fluctuations to be correlated across locations, is not well understood. Synchrony has destabilizing effects on ecosystems, adding to the importance of understanding spatiotemporal patterns of synchrony transmission. In order to understand whether and how spatial synchrony cascades across the marine-terrestrial boundary via resource subsidies, we studied the relationship between giant kelp forests on rocky nearshore reefs and sandy beach ecosystems that receive resource subsidies in the form of kelp wrack (detritus). We found that synchrony cascades from rocky reefs to sandy beaches, with spatiotemporal patterns mediated by fluctuations in live kelp biomass, wave action, and beach width. Moreover, wrack deposition synchronized local abundances of shorebirds that move among beaches seeking to forage on wrack-associated invertebrates, demonstrating that synchrony due to subsidies propagates across trophic levels in the recipient ecosystem. Synchronizing resource subsidies likely play an underappreciated role in the spatiotemporal structure, functioning, and stability of ecosystems."

Oregon State University researchers have discovered vitamin B1 produced by microbes in rivers, findings that may offer hope for vitamin-deficient salmon populations.

Findings were published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology.
The authors say the study in California's Central Valley represents a novel piece of an important physiological puzzle involving Chinook salmon, a keystone species that holds significant cultural, ecological and economic importance in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.
Christopher Suffridge, senior research associate in the Department of Microbiology in the OSU College of Science, and doctoral student Kelly Shannon examined concentrations of thiamine and the microbial communities in rivers of the Sacramento River watershed. Thiamine is the compound commonly referred to as vitamin B1 and is critical to cellular function in all living organisms.
""This study is the first-ever report of thiamine compounds in salmon spawning rivers and the associated gravels where salmon spawn,"" Suffridge said. ""This source of thiamine has potential implications for reducing health impacts on naturally spawning salmon that are suffering from thiamine deficiency complex.""
TDC, an emerging threat to the stability of West Coast salmon populations, has affected salmon and trout in lake systems in northeastern North America and Atlantic salmon in the Baltic Sea.
Chinook salmon in the Central Valley have recently been diagnosed with TDC, the researchers note. Afflicted female salmon that return to rivers and streams to spawn can pass the deficiency on to their hatchlings, which have problems swimming and experience high mortality rates.

""In California, most hatchery-spawning Chinook salmon are treated with thiamine to prevent TDC,"" Suffridge said. ""However, it was previously unknown if there was a source of thiamine in the environment that could potentially rescue naturally spawning salmon afflicted with TDC. We have now identified microbially produced thiamine in natural salmon spawning habitats.""
""It's a complicated issue,"" Shannon added. ""The broader context is that Central Valley Chinook salmon, as well as some populations of salmon in other places, are becoming thiamine deficient because of shifts in their diet in their feeding grounds.""
Historically, Shannon said, Central Valley Chinook salmon ate a diverse, healthy diet consisting of many different species of prey fish. But in recent years, shifts in the ocean ecosystem have caused northern anchovy populations to explode, meaning they've become the primary dietary component for salmon. This change in diet is the likely cause of TDC, he said.
""Northern anchovies are high in an enzyme called thiaminase that degrades thiamine,"" Shannon said. ""So by the time many California Central Valley Chinook salmon are ready to spawn they have been feeding on so many anchovies that they have become deficient in thiamine from the activity of the thiaminase enzyme in anchovies.""
The results of the new study implicate river sediments as likely sources of microbial thiamine, which could supplement early life stages of Chinook salmon that experience TDC, he said. Future studies will examine to what degree environmental thiamine acquisition by adult Chinook salmon, their incubating eggs and hatched fry could alleviate the negative health outcomes caused by TDC.
""It was unknown if the vitamin could even be measured in rivers in the first place, and the thiamine concentrations we measured were much lower -- more than a million times lower -- than a hatchery thiamine bath,"" Shannon added. ""The data have implications for salmon health but are not concrete enough to say anything definitive. More research is needed to determine what role the environmental thiamine might play, but obviously learning that it's there is an important first step.""
The collaboration included Rick Colwell, a professor in the OSU College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences, and Hailey Matthews, who graduated from the Oregon State Honors College in June 2023.
Also taking part in the study were scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the University of California, Davis, Bronx Community College and the California Department of Water Resources.

Salmonid eggs and embryos can assimilate exogenous thiamine, and evidence suggests that microbial communities in benthic environments can produce substantial amounts of thiamine. We therefore hypothesize that natural dissolved pools of thiamine exist in the surface water and hyporheic zones of riverine habitats where salmonids with TDC migrate, spawn, and begin their lives. To examine the relationship between dissolved thiamine-related compounds (dTRCs) and their microbial source, we determined the concentrations of these metabolites and the compositions of microbial communities in surface and hyporheic waters of the Sacramento River, California and its tributaries. Here we determine that all dTRCs are present in femto-picomolar concentrations in a range of critically important salmon spawning habitats. We observed that thiamine concentrations in the Sacramento River system are orders of magnitude lower than those of marine waters, indicating substantial differences in thiamine cycling between these two environments. Our data suggest that the hyporheic zone is likely the source of thiamine to the overlying surface water. Temporal variations in dTRC concentrations were observed where the highest concentrations existed when Chinook salmon were actively spawning. Significant correlations were seen between the richness of microbial taxa and dTRC concentrations, particularly in the hyporheic zone, which would influence the conditions where embryonic salmon incubate. Together, these results indicate a connection between microbial communities in freshwater habitats and the availability of thiamine to spawning TDC-impacted California Central Valley Chinook salmon. Pacific salmon are keystone species with considerable economic importance and immeasurable cultural significance to Pacific Northwest indigenous peoples. Thiamine deficiency complex has recently been diagnosed as an emerging threat to the health and stability of multiple populations of salmonids ranging from California to Alaska. Microbial biosynthesis is the major source of thiamine in marine and aquatic environments. Despite this importance, the concentrations of thiamine and the identities of the microbial communities that cycle it are largely unknown. Here we investigate microbial communities and their relationship to thiamine in Chinook salmon spawning habitats in California’s Sacramento River system to gain an understanding of how thiamine availability impacts salmonids suffering from thiamine deficiency complex."

Fossils of a new group of animal predators have been located in the Early Cambrian Sirius Passet fossil locality in North Greenland. These large worms may be some of the earliest carnivorous animals to have colonised the water column more than 518 million years ago, revealing a past dynasty of predators that scientists didn't know existed.

The new fossil animals have been named Timorebestia, meaning 'terror beasts' in Latin. Adorned with fins down the sides of their body, a distinct head with long antennae, massive jaw structures inside their mouth and growing to more than 30cm in length, these were some of the largest swimming animals in the Early Cambrian times.
""We have previously known that primitive arthropods were the dominant predators during the Cambrian, such as the bizarre-looking anomalocaridids,"" said Dr Jakob Vinther from the University of Bristol's Schools of Earth Sciences and Biological Sciences, a senior author on the study. ""However, Timorebestia is a distant, but close, relative of living arrow worms, or chaetognaths. These are much smaller ocean predators today that feed on tiny zooplankton.
""Our research shows that these ancient ocean ecosystems were fairly complex with a food chain that allowed for several tiers of predators.
""Timorebestia were giants of their day and would have been close to the top of the food chain. That makes it equivalent in importance to some of the top carnivores in modern oceans, such as sharks and seals back in the Cambrian period.""
Inside the fossilised digestive system of Timorebestia, the researchers found remains of a common, swimming arthropod called Isoxys. ""We can see these arthropods was a food source many other animals,"" said Morten Lunde Nielsen, a former PhD student at Bristol and part of the current study. ""They are very common at Sirius Passet and had long protective spines, pointing both forwards and backwards. However, they clearly didn't completely succeed in avoiding that fate, because Timorebestia munched on them in great quantities.""
Arrow worms are one of the oldest animal fossils from the Cambrian. While arthropods appear in the fossil record about 521 to 529 million years ago, arrow worms can be traced back at least 538 million years back in time. Dr Vinther explained: ""Both arrow worms, and the more primitive Timorebestia, were swimming predators. We can therefore surmise that in all likelihood they were the predators that dominated the oceans before arthropods took off. Perhaps they had a dynasty of about 10-15 million years before they got superseded by other, and more successful, groups.""
Luke Parry from Oxford University, who was part of the study, added ""Timorebestia is a really significant find for understanding where these jawed predators came from. Today, arrow worms have menacing bristles on the outside of their heads for catching prey, whereas Timorebestia has jaws inside its head. This is what we see in microscopic jaw worms today -- organisms that arrow worms shared an ancestor with over half a billion years ago. Timorebestia and other fossils like it provide links between closely related organisms that today look very different.""

""Our discovery firms up how arrow worms evolved,"" added Tae Yoon Park from the Korean Polar Research Institute, the other senior author and field expedition leader. ""Living arrow worms have a distinct nervous centre on their belly, called a ventral ganglion. It is entirely unique to these animals.
""We have found this preserved in Timorebestia and another fossil called Amiskwia. People have debated whether or not Amiskwia was closely related to arrow worms, as part of their evolutionary stem lineage. The preservation of these unique ventral ganglia gives us a great deal more confidence in this hypothesis.
""We are very excited to have discovered such unique predators in Sirius Passet. Over a series of expeditions to the very remote Sirius Passet in the furthest reaches of North Greenland more than 82,5? north, we have collected a great diversity of exciting new organisms. Thanks to the remarkable, exceptional preservation in Sirius Passet we can also reveal exciting anatomical details including their digestive system, muscle anatomy, and nervous systems.
""We have many more exciting findings to share in the coming years that will help show how the earliest animal ecosystems looked like and evolved."" Dr Park concludes.

Amiskwia has previously been interpreted as a total-group chaetognathiferan, as either a stem-chaetognath or gnathostomulid. We show that T. koprii shares a ventral ganglion with chaetognaths to the exclusion of other animal groups, firmly placing these fossils on the chaetognath stem. The large size (up to 30 cm) and gut contents in T. koprii suggest that early chaetognaths occupied a higher trophic position in pelagic food chains than today."

Chlorophyll plays a pivotal role in photosynthesis, which is why plants have evolved to have high chlorophyll levels in their leaves. However, making this pigment is expensive because plants invest a significant portion of the available nitrogen in both chlorophyll and the special proteins that bind it. As a result, nitrogen is unavailable for other processes. In a new study, researchers reduced the chlorophyll levels in leaves to see if the plant would invest the nitrogen saved into other process that might improve nutritional quality.

Over the past few decades, researchers have been trying to increase crop yield to meet the global food demand. One of their biggest challenges has been to improve the photosynthetic efficiency of agricultural crops.
When light hits a leaf, one of three things can happen: the leaf can absorb the light for photosynthesis, the leaf can reflect it back into the atmosphere, or the light can pass through the leaf. Unfortunately, even though a fully green leaf absorbs over 90% of the light that hits it, the leaf doesn't use it all for photosynthesis.
""We grow our crop plants at very high densities. As a result, although the leaves at the top of the canopy have more light, they cannot use it all and the layer below is light starved,"" said Don Ort (GEGC leader/CABBI/BSD), a professor of integrative biology. ""Our rationale was to reduce the amount of chlorophyll at the top of the canopy so more light can penetrate and be used more efficiently lower in the canopy.""
In the current study, the researchers engineered tobacco plants to have lower chlorophyll levels as the crop canopy grows more dense.
""Previous models have shown that if you have lower chlorophyll levels before you have a dense canopy, it is detrimental to plant growth,"" Ort said. ""We wanted to take plants that have full canopies and ensure that the new leaves that are added on top have lower chlorophyll levels.""
To do so, the researchers used small RNAs that interfere with key steps in chlorophyll synthesis. The production of these small RNAs were put under the control of an inducible promoter -- a piece of DNA that responds to a specific signal and directs the cell to produce RNA.

In the study, the researchers used an ethanol-inducible promoter. When they sprayed the leaves with ethanol, the resulting small RNAs interfered with the synthesis of chlorophyll, creating a canopy that had a lighter shade of green.
""We found that even when chlorophyll synthesis decreased 70%, there was no inhibition of growth,"" said Young Cho, a postdoctoral researcher in the Ort lab and the study's lead author. ""Although we had theoretically predicted this result, observing these pale green or yellow plants growing normally was astonishing, considering that such discoloration typically indicates plant illness.""
The researchers had also hypothesized that decreasing the amount of chlorophyll would influence other aspects of plant growth because it would free up the nitrogen that was being invested into making the pigment and associated proteins. They were proven right when they saw that the seed nitrogen concentration was 17% higher in the plants in which the ethanol-inducible promoter controlling the interfering small RNAs were activated.
""We had also expected an increase in yield because as you get more light into the canopy, you would expect it to be used more efficiently,"" Ort said. ""However, we didn't detect an increase, which probably means that the plants did not invest enough of the extra nitrogen to improve the photosynthetic capacity in the lower parts of the canopy. This result gives us another engineering target.""
In their future work, the researchers will test whether they can get similar results with light-inducible promoters, which farmers will find easier to use. ""Ethanol-inducible promoters are very convenient and important research tools. However, farmers will not want to spray an entire field with ethanol, so we need to look at other promoters that respond to the intensity or the color of light,"" Ort said.

While evolution has been selected for high chlorophyll content in leaves, previous work suggests that domesticated crops grown in modern high‐density agricultural environments overinvest in chlorophyll production, thereby lowering light use and nitrogen use efficiency. To investigate the potential benefits of reducing chlorophyll levels, we created ethanol‐inducible RNAi tobacco mutants that suppress Mg‐chelatase subunit I (CHLI) with small RNA within 3 h of induction and reduce chlorophyll within 5 days in field conditions. We initiated chlorophyll reduction later in plant development to avoid the highly sensitive seedling stage and to allow young plants to have full green leaves to maximise light interception before canopy formation. This study demonstrated that leaf chlorophyll reduction >60% during seed‐filling stages increased tobacco seed nitrogen concentration by as much as 17% while canopy photosynthesis, biomass and seed yields were maintained. These results indicate that time‐specific reduction of chlorophyll could be a novel strategy that decouples the inverse relationship between yield and seed nitrogen by utilising saved nitrogen from the reduction of chlorophyll while maintaining full carbon assimilation capacity."

Many bacterial pathogens use small injection apparatuses to manipulate the cells of their hosts, such as humans, so that they can spread throughout the body. To do this, they need to fill their syringes with the relevant injection agent. A technique that tracks the individual movement of proteins revealed how bacteria accomplish this challenging task.

Disease-causing bacteria of the genus Salmonella or Yersinia can use tiny injection apparatuses to inject harmful proteins into host cells, much to the discomfort of the infected person. However, it is not only with a view to controlling disease that researchers are investigating the injection mechanism of these so-called type III secretion systems, also known as ""injectisomes.""
If the structure and function of the injectisome were fully understood, researchers would be able to hijack it to deliver specific drugs into cells, such as cancer cells. In fact, the structure of the injectisome has already been elucidated. However, it remained unclear how the bacteria load their syringes so that the right proteins are injected at the right time.
Mobile components of the injectisome search for proteins
A team of scientists led by Andreas Diepold from the Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology in Marburg and Ulrike Endesfelder from the University of Bonn has now been able to answer this question: mobile components of the injectisome comb through the bacterial cell in search of the proteins to be injected, so-called effectors. When they encounter an effector, they transport it like a shuttle bus to the gate of the injection needle.
""How proteins of the sorting platform in the cytosol bind to effectors and deliver the cargo to the export gate of the membrane-bound injectisome is comparable to the processes at a freight terminal,"" explains Stephan Wimmi, first author of the study as a postdoctoral researcher in Andreas Diepold's laboratory. ""We think that this shuttle mechanism helps to make the injection efficient and specific at the same time -- after all, the bacteria have to inject the right proteins quickly to avoid being recognized and eliminated by the immune system, for example.""
To gain this insight into the important loading mechanism of the injectisome, the researchers had to apply new techniques. ""Conventional methods, which are normally used to detect that proteins bind to each other, did not work to answer this question -- possibly because the effectors are only bound for a short time and then immediately injected,"" explains Andreas Diepold, research group leader at the Max Planck Institute and co-leader of the study. ""That's why we had to analyse this binding in situ in the living bacteria.""
""To measure these transient interactions we made use of two novel approaches that work in living cells, proximity labeling and single-particle tracking,"" adds Ulrike Endesfelder, whose group worked on the study in three different locations -- the Max Planck Institute in Marburg, Carnogie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, and at the University in Bonn. Proximity labeling, in which a protein marks its immediate neighbors like a paintbrush, enabled them to show that the effectors in the bacterium bind to the mobile injectisome components. This binding was examined in more detail using single particle tracking, a high-resolution microscopy method that can follow individual proteins in cells. These methods, which the team refers to as ""in situ biochemistry,"" i.e. biochemical investigations on site, made the breakthrough possible.
The researchers next want to use their method to investigate other mechanisms that bacteria use to cause infections. ""The more we know about how bacteria use these systems during an infection, the better we can understand how we can influence them -- be it to prevent infections or to modify the systems in order to use them in the fields of medicine or biotechnology,"" says Andreas Diepold.

Recruitment of effectors to the machinery and the resulting export hierarchy involve the sorting platform. These conserved proteins form pod structures at the cytosolic interface of the injectisome but are also mobile in the cytosol. Photoactivated localization microscopy in Yersinia enterocolitica revealed a direct interaction of the sorting platform proteins SctQ and SctL with effectors in the cytosol of live bacteria. These proteins form larger cytosolic protein complexes involving the ATPase SctN and the membrane connector SctK. The mobility and composition of these mobile pod structures are modulated in the presence of effectors and their chaperones, and upon initiation of secretion, which also increases the number of injectisomes from ~5 to ~18 per bacterium. Our quantitative data support an effector shuttling mechanism, in which sorting platform proteins bind to effectors in the cytosol and deliver the cargo to the export gate at the membrane-bound injectisome."

Primates -- and this includes humans -- are thought of as highly social animals. Many species of monkeys and apes live in groups. Lemurs and other Strepsirrhines, often colloquially referred to as ""wet-nosed"" primates, in contrast, have long been believed to be solitary creatures, and it has often been suggested that other forms of social organization evolved later. Previous studies have therefore attempted to explain how and when pair-living evolved in primates.

More recent research, however, indicates that many nocturnal Strepsirrhines, which are more challenging to investigate, are not in fact solitary but live in pairs of males and females. But what does this mean for the social organization forms of the ancestors of all primates? And why do some species of monkey live in groups, while others are pair-living or solitary?
Different forms of social organization
Researchers at the Universities of Zurich and Strasbourg have now examined these questions. For their study, Charlotte Olivier from the Hubert Curien Pluridisciplinary Institute collected detailed information on the composition of social units in primate populations in the wild. Over several years, the researchers built a detailed database, which covered almost 500 populations from over 200 primate species, from primary field studies.
More than half of the primate species recorded in the database exhibited more than one form of social organization. ""The most common social organization were groups in which multiple females and multiple males lived together, for example chimpanzees or macaques, followed by groups with only one male and multiple females -- such as in gorillas or langurs,"" says last author Adrian Jaeggi from the University of Zurich. ""But one-quarter of all species lived in pairs.""
Smaller ancestors coupled up
Taking into account several socioecological and life history variables such as body size, diet or habitat, the researchers calculated the probability of different forms of social organization, including for our ancestors who lived some 70 million years ago. The calculations were based on complex statistical models developed by Jordan Martin at UZH's Institute of Evolutionary Medicine.
To reconstruct the ancestral state of primates, the researchers relied on fossils, which showed that ancestral primates were relatively small-bodied and arboreal -- factors that strongly correlate with pair-living. ""Our model shows that the ancestral social organization of primates was variable and that pair-living was by far the most likely form,"" says Martin. Only about 15 percent of our ancestors were solitary, he adds. ""Living in larger groups therefore only evolved later in the history of primates.""
Pairs with benefits
In other words, the social structure of early primates was likely more similar to that of humans today than previously assumed. ""Many, but by no means all of us, live in pairs while also being a part of extended families and larger groups and societies,"" Jaeggi says. However, pair-living among early primates did not equate to sexual monogamy or cooperative infant care, he adds. ""It is more likely that a specific female and a specific male would be seen together for most of the time and share the same home range and sleeping site, which was more advantageous to them than solitary living,"" explains last author Carsten Schradin from Strasbourg. This enabled them to fend off competitors or keep each other warm, for example.

It has often been suggested that the ancestor of all primates was solitary and that other forms of social organization evolved later, with transitions being driven by various life history traits and ecological factors. However, recent research showed that many understudied primate species previously assumed to be solitary actually live in pairs, and intraspecific variation in social organization is common. We built a detailed database from primary field studies quantifying the number of social units expressing different social organizations in each population. We used Bayesian phylogenetic models to infer the probability of each social organization, conditional on several socioecological and life history predictors. Here, we show that when intraspecific variation is accounted for, the ancestral social organization of primates was inferred to be variable, with the most common social organization being pair-living but with approximately 10 to 20% of social units of the ancestral population deviating from this pattern by being solitary living. Body size and activity patterns had large effects on transitions between types of social organizations. As in other mammalian clades, pair-living is closely linked to small body size and likely more common in ancestral species. Our results challenge the assumption that ancestral primates were solitary and that pair-living evolved afterward emphasizing the importance of focusing on field data and accounting for intraspecific variation, providing a flexible statistical framework for doing so."

A UC Riverside study to motivate your new year's resolutions: it demonstrates that high-fat diets affect genes linked not only to obesity, colon cancer and irritable bowels, but also to the immune system, brain function, and potentially COVID-19 risk.

While other studies have examined the effects of a high-fat diet, this one is unusual in its scope. UCR researchers fed mice three different diets over the course of 24 weeks where at least 40% of the calories came from fat. Then, they looked not only at the microbiome, but also at genetic changes in all four parts of the intestines.
One group of mice ate a diet based on saturated fat from coconut oil, another got a monounsaturated, modified soybean oil, a third got an unmodified soybean oil high in polyunsaturated fat. Compared to a low-fat control diet, all three groups experienced concerning changes in gene expression, the process that turns genetic information into a functional product, such as a protein.
""Word on the street is that plant-based diets are better for you, and in many cases that's true. However, a diet high in fat, even from a plant, is one case where it's just not true,"" said Frances Sladek, a UCR cell biology professor and senior author of the new study.
A new Scientific Reports paper about the study documents the many impacts of high-fat diets. Some of the intestinal changes did not surprise the researchers, such as major changes in genes related to fat metabolism and the composition of gut bacteria. For example, they observed an increase in pathogenic E. coli and a suppression of Bacteroides, which helps protect the body against pathogens.
Other observations were more surprising, such as changes in genes regulating susceptibility to infectious diseases. ""We saw pattern recognition genes, ones that recognize infectious bacteria, take a hit. We saw cytokine signaling genes take a hit, which help the body control inflammation,"" Sladek said. 'So, it's a double whammy. These diets impair immune system genes in the host, and they also create an environment in which harmful gut bacteria can thrive.""
The team's previous work with soybean oil documents its link to obesity and diabetes, both major risk factors for COVID. This paper now shows that all three high-fat diets increase the expression of ACE2 and other host proteins that are used by COVID spike proteins to enter the body.

Additionally, the team observed that high-fat food increased signs of stem cells in the colon. ""You'd think that would be a good thing, but actually they can be precursors to cancer,"" Sladek said.
In terms of effects on gene expression, coconut oil showed the greatest number of changes, followed by the unmodified soybean oil. Differences between the two soybean oils suggest that polyunsaturated fatty acids in unmodified soybean oil, primarily linoleic acid, play a role in altering gene expression.
Negative changes to the microbiome in this study were more pronounced in mice fed the soybean oil diet. This was unsurprising, as the same research team previously documented other negative health effects of high soybean oil consumption.
In 2015, the team found that soybean oil induces obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and fatty liver in mice. In 2020, the researchers team demonstrated the oil could also affect genes in the brain related to conditions like autism, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, and depression.
Interestingly, in their current work they also found the expression of several neurotransmitter genes were changed by the high fat diets, reinforcing the notion of a gut-brain axis that can be impacted by diet.
The researchers have noted that these findings only apply to soybean oil, and not to other soy products, tofu, or soybeans themselves. ""There are some really good things about soybeans. But too much of that oil is just not good for you,"" said UCR microbiologist Poonamjot Deol, who was co-first author of the current study along with UCR postdoctoral researcher Jose Martinez-Lomeli.

Also, the studies were conducted using mice, and mouse studies do not always translate to the same results in humans. However, humans and mice share 97.5% of their working DNA. Therefore, the findings are concerning, as soybean oil is the most commonly consumed oil in the United States, and is increasingly being used in other countries, including Brazil, China, and India.
By some estimates, Americans tend to get nearly 40% of their calories from fat, which mirrors what the mice were fed in this study. ""Some fat is necessary in the diet, perhaps 10 to 15%. Most people though, at least in this country, are getting at least three times the amount that they need,"" Deol said.
Readers should not panic about a single meal. It is the long-term high-fat habit that caused the observed changes. Recall that the mice were fed these diets for 24 weeks. ""In human terms, that is like starting from childhood and continuing until middle age. One night of indulgence is not what these mice ate. It's more like a lifetime of the food,"" Deol said.
That said, the researchers hope the study will cause people to closely examine their eating habits.
""Some people think, 'Oh, I'll just exercise more and be okay. But regularly eating this way could be impacting your immune system and how your brain functions,"" Deol said. ""You may not be able to just exercise away these effects.""

In this study, we examined the impact on intestinal gene expression of three isocaloric HFDs that differed only in their fatty acid composition—coconut oil (saturated fats), conventional soybean oil (polyunsaturated fats) and a genetically modified soybean oil (monounsaturated fats). Four functionally distinct segments of the mouse intestinal tract were analyzed using RNA-seq—duodenum, jejunum, terminal ileum and proximal colon. We found considerable dysregulation of genes in multiple tissues with the different diets, including those encoding nuclear receptors and genes involved in xenobiotic and drug metabolism, epithelial barrier function, IBD and colon cancer as well as genes associated with the microbiome and COVID-19. Network analysis shows that genes involved in metabolism tend to be upregulated by the HFDs while genes related to the immune system are downregulated; neurotransmitter signaling was also dysregulated by the HFDs. Genomic sequencing also revealed a microbiome altered by the HFDs. This study highlights the potential impact of different HFDs on gut health with implications for the organism as a whole and will serve as a reference for gene expression along the length of the intestines."

For talkative midshipman fish -- sometimes called the ""California singing fish"" -- the midbrain plays a robust role in initiating and patterning of sounds used in vocal communication.

The midbrain in these fish, it turns out, may serve as a useful model for how mammals and other vertebrates, including humans, control vocal expressions, according to Cornell University behavioral research published in Nature Communications.
Midshipman fish phrasing takes the form of grunts, growls and hums whenever the males seek mates or fend off foes, said senior author Andrew Bass, professor of neurobiology and behavior. To the human ear, the hum might sound like a single note on a French horn or a foghorn.
Science has known that mammals and other vertebrates emit sound and vocalize to communicate behaviors, but the midbrain responsible for initiating acoustic features -- like patterned hums in these fish or the formation of cogent sentences in humans -- had largely gone unexplored.
Researchers found that midbrain periaqueductal gray neurons in the fish are activated in distinct patterns by the males during courtship calls, foraging and nest guarding duty.
The group confirmed that the periaqueductal gray neurons evoke output to the muscles that manage sound and the vocal features of courtship, as well as show patterning other kinds of calls.
Communication signals patterned by the midbrain ""have frequency and amplitude components, and the fish string together sounds in different ways,"" Bass said. ""Maybe those sounds mean aggression or serve as a mating function -- like you're trying to attract a mate to a nest, which male midshipman do with their hum.""
The human brain is in the shape of a helmet and the midbrain sits at the top of brain's ""stem."" Fish brains are shaped more like a tube -- making them a more accessible model to study experimentally, Bass said. ""Our findings now show that fish and mammals share functionally comparable periaqueductal gray nodes that can influence the acoustic structure of social context-specific vocal signals,"" he said.

Bass noted that for humans, this research provides clues to what happens if the human midbrain gets damaged. He suggested that this research may help us understand how a malfunctioning human midbrain may render a person uncommunicative or mute.
""It's only been in the past few years, where the midbrain has gotten more attention from neuroscientists studying social communication,"" said Bass. ""It is a major node connected to your cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala and hypothalamus. In this way it acts as a gateway for these sources of executive functions to reach other brain regions more directly activating muscles that underlie behavioral actions.""
Said Bass: ""The midbrain is an amazing part of the brain because it points to how essential it is -- if you are a vertebrate -- to have the ability to produce sound communication signals. Period.""
The National Science Foundation funded this research.

Yet, how brain regions actively pattern the acoustic features of context-specific vocal signals remains largely unexplored. The midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a major site for initiating vocalization among mammals, including primates. We show that PAG neurons in a highly vocal fish species (Porichthys notatus) are activated in distinct patterns during agonistic versus courtship calling by males, with few co-activated during a non-vocal behaviour, foraging. Pharmacological manipulations within vocally active PAG, but not hindbrain, sites evoke vocal network output to sonic muscles matching the temporal features of courtship and agonistic calls, showing that a balance of inhibitory and excitatory dynamics is likely necessary for patterning different call types. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that vocal species of fish and mammals share functionally comparable PAG nodes that in some species can influence the acoustic structure of social context-specific vocal signals."

A University of Queensland-led study has found humans can tell if chickens are excited or displeased, just by the sound of their clucks.

Professor Joerg Henning from UQ's School of Veterinary Science said researchers investigated whether humans could correctly identify the context of calls or clucking sounds made by domestic chickens, the most commonly farmed species in the world.
""In this study, we used recordings of chickens vocalising in all different scenarios from a previous experiment,"" Professor Henning said.
""Two calls were produced in anticipation of a reward, which we called the 'food' call and the 'fast cluck'.
""Two other call types were produced in non-reward contexts, such as food being withheld, which we called the 'whine' and 'gakel' calls.""
The researchers played the audio files back to test whether humans could tell in which context the chicken sounds were made, and whether various demographics and levels of experience with chickens affected their correct identification.
""We found 69 per cent of all participants could correctly tell if a chicken sounded excited or displeased,"" Professor Henning said.

""This is a remarkable result and further strengthens evidence that humans have the ability to perceive the emotional context of vocalisations made by different species.""
Professor Henning said the ability to detect emotional information from vocalisation could improve the welfare of farmed chickens.
""A substantial proportion of participants being able to successfully recognise calls produced in reward-related contexts is significant,"" he said.
""It provides confidence that people involved in chicken husbandry can identify the emotional state of the birds they look after, even if they don't have prior experience.
""Our hope is that in future research, specific acoustic cues that predict how humans rate arousal in chicken calls could be identified, and these results could potentially be used in artificially intelligent based detection systems to monitor vocalisations in chickens.
""This would allow for the development of automated assessments of compromised or good welfare states within poultry management systems.
""Ultimately this could enhance the management of farmed chickens to improve their welfare, while helping conscientious consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions.""

Participants ( n = 194) listened to eight calls when chickens were anticipating a reward, and eight calls in non-rewarded contexts, and indicated whether the vocalizing chicken was experiencing pleasure/displeasure, and high/low excitement, using visual analogue scales.

A new analysis of fossils believed to be juveniles of T. rex now shows they were adults of a small tyrannosaur, with narrower jaws, longer legs, and bigger arms than T. rex. The species, Nanotyrannus lancensis, was first named decades ago but later reinterpreted as a young T. rex.

The first skull of Nanotyrannus was found in Montana in 1942, but for decades, paleontologists have gone back and forth on whether it was a separate species, or simply a juvenile of the much larger T. rex.
Dr Nick Longrich, from the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath (UK), and Dr Evan Saitta, from the University of Chicago (USA) re-analysed the fossils, looking at growth rings, the anatomy of Nanotyrannus, and a previously unrecognized fossil of a young T. rex.
Measuring the growth rings in Nanotyrannus bones, they showed that they became more closely packed towards the outside of the bone -- its growth was slowing. It suggests these animals were nearly full size; not fast-growing juveniles.
Modelling the growth of the fossils showed the animals would have reached a maximum of around 900-1500 kilograms and five metres -- about 15 per cent of the size of the giant T. rex, which grew to 8,000 kilograms and nine metres or more.
The researchers have published their findings in Fossil Studies.
""When I saw these results I was pretty blown away,"" said Longrich. ""I didn't expect it to be quite so conclusive.

""If they were young T. rex they should be growing like crazy, putting on hundreds of kilograms a year, but we're not seeing that.
""We tried modeling the data in a lot of different ways and we kept getting low growth rates. This is looking like the end for the hypothesis that these animals are young T. rex.""
Supporting the existence of distinct species, the researchers found no evidence of fossils combining features of both the Nanotyrannus and T. rex - which would exist if the one turned into the other. Every fossil they examined could be confidently identified as one species or the other.
Neither did the patterns of growth in other tyrannosaurs fit with the hypothesis that these were young T. rex.
Dr Longrich said: ""If you look at juveniles of other tyrannosaurs, they show many of the distinctive features of the adults. A very young Tarbosaurus - a close relative of T. rex - shows distinctive features of the adults.
""In the same way that kittens look like cats and puppies look like dogs, the juveniles of different tyrannosaurs are distinctive. And Nanotyrannus just doesn't look anything like a T. rex.

""It could be growing in a way that's completely unlike any other tyrannosaur, or any other dinosaur- but it's more likely it's just not a T. rex.""
But that raises a mystery -- if Nanotyrannus isn't a juvenile Tyrannosaurus, then why hasn't anyone ever found a young T. rex?
""That's always been one of the big questions. Well, it turns out we actually had found one,"" said Longrich. ""But the fossil was collected years ago, stuck in a box of unidentified bones in a museum drawer, and then forgotten.""
The research led Longrich and co-author Evan Saitta to a previous fossil discovery, stored in a museum in San Francisco which they identified as a juvenile Tyrannosaurus.
That young T. rex is represented by a skull bone -- the frontal bone -- with distinctive features that ally it with Tyrannosaurus, but which aren't seen in Nanotyrannus. It comes from a small animal, one with a skull about 45 cm long and a body length of around 5 metres.
Dr Longrich said: ""Yes, it's just one specimen, and just one bone, but it only takes one. T. rex skull bones are very distinctive, nothing else looks like it. Young T. rex exist, they're just incredibly rare, like juveniles of most dinosaurs.""
The researchers argue these findings are strong evidence that Nanotyrannus is a separate species, one not closely related to Tyrannosaurus. It was more lightly-built and long-limbed than its thick-set relative. It also had larger arms, unlike the famously short-armed T. rex.
""The arms are actually longer than those of T. rex. Even the biggest T. rex, has shorter arms and smaller claws than in these little Nanotyrannus. This was an animal where the arms were actually pretty formidable weapons. It's really just a completely different animal -- small, fast, agile.
""T. rex relied on size and strength, but this animal relied on speed.""
The long arms and other features suggest it was only distantly related to T. rex - and may have sat outside the family Tyrannosauridae, which T. rex is part of, in its own family of predatory dinosaurs.
The new study is the latest in a series of publications on the problem, going back decades.
Longrich said: ""Nanotyrannus is highly controversial in paleontology. Not long ago, it seemed like we'd finally settled this problem, and it was a young T. rex.
""I was very skeptical about Nanotyrannus myself until about six years ago when I took a close look at the fossils and was surprised to realise we'd gotten it wrong all these years.""
The authors suggest that, given how difficult it is to tell dinosaurs apart based on their often-incomplete skeletons, we may be underestimating the diversity of dinosaurs, and other fossil species.
Longrich said: ""It's amazing to think how much we still don't know about the most famous of all the dinosaurs. It makes you wonder what else we've gotten wrong.""

We examine multiple lines of evidence and show that the evidence strongly supports recognition of Nanotyrannus as a distinct species for the following reasons: 1. High diversity of tyrannosaurs and predatory dinosaurs supports the idea that multiple tyrannosaurids inhabited the late Maastrichtian of Laramidia; 2. Nanotyrannus lacks characters supporting referral to Tyrannosaurus or Tyrannosaurinae but differs from T. rex in >150 morphological characters, while intermediate forms combining the features of Nanotyrannus and T. rex are unknown; 3. Histology shows specimens of Nanotyrannus showing (i) skeletal fusions, (ii) mature skull bone textures, (iii) slow growth rates relative to T. rex, (iv) decelerating growth in their final years of life, and (v) growth curves predicting adult masses of ~1500 kg or less, showing these animals are subadults and young adults, not juvenile Tyrannosaurus; 4. growth series of other tyrannosaurids, including Tarbosaurus and Gorgosaurus, do not show morphological changes proposed for a Nanotyrannus–Tyrannosaurus growth series, and deriving Tyrannosaurus from Nanotyrannus requires several changes inconsistent with known patterns of dinosaur development; 5.

Tyrannosaur diversity before the K-Pg extinction is higher than previously appreciated. The challenges inherent in diagnosing species based on fossils mean paleontologists may be systematically underestimating the diversity of ancient ecosystems."

The Matabele ants (Megaponera analis), which are widespread south of the Sahara, have a narrow diet: They only eat termites. Their hunting expeditions are dangerous because termite soldiers defend their conspecifics -- and use their powerful mandibles to do so. It is therefore common for the ants to be injured while hunting.

If the wounds become infected, there is a significant survival risk. However, Matabele ants have developed a sophisticated healthcare system: they can distinguish between non-infected and infected wounds and treat the latter efficiently with antibiotics they produce themselves. This is reported by a team led by Dr Erik Frank from Julius-Maximilians-Universität (JMU) Würzburg and Professor Laurent Keller from the University of Lausanne in the journal Nature Communications.
Treatment Drastically Reduces Mortality
""Chemical analyses in cooperation with JMU Professor Thomas Schmitt have shown that the hydrocarbon profile of the ant cuticle changes as a result of a wound infection,"" says Erik Frank. It is precisely this change that the ants are able to recognise and thus diagnose the infection status of injured nestmates.
For treatment, they then apply antimicrobial compounds and proteins to the infected wounds. They take these antibiotics from the metapleural gland, which is located on the side of their thorax. Its secretion contains 112 components, half of which have an antimicrobial or wound-healing effect. And the therapy is highly effective: the mortality rate of infected individuals is reduced by 90 per cent, as the research group discovered.
Analysis of Ant Antibiotics is Planned
""With the exception of humans, I know of no other living creature that can carry out such sophisticated medical wound treatments,"" says Erik Frank. Laurent Keller also adds that these findings ""have medical implications because the primary pathogen in ant's wounds, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is also a leading cause of infection in humans, with several strains being resistant to antibiotics.""
Are Matabele ants really unique in this respect? The Würzburg researcher now wants to explore wound care behaviours in other ant species and other social animals. He also wants to identify and analyse the antibiotics used by Matabele ants in cooperation with chemistry research groups. This may lead to the discovery of new antibiotics that could also be used in humans.
A few years ago, Erik Frank's research into the African ants that care for their injured nestmates sparked the interest of a film production company. The company was commissioned by Netflix to find exciting stories for the eight-part nature documentary ""Life on Our Planet,"" which focuses on the evolution of life over the past 500 million years.

Injuries are common in the ant Megaponera analis, which raids pugnacious prey. Here we show that M. analis can determine when wounds are infected and treat them accordingly. By applying a variety of antimicrobial compounds and proteins secreted from the metapleural gland to infected wounds, workers reduce the mortality of infected individuals by 90%. Chemical analyses showed that wound infection is associated with specific changes in the cuticular hydrocarbon profile, thereby likely allowing nestmates to diagnose the infection state of injured individuals and apply the appropriate antimicrobial treatment. This study demonstrates that M. analis ant societies use antimicrobial compounds produced in the metapleural glands to treat infected wounds and reduce nestmate mortality."

Synthetic biology offers the opportunity to build biochemical pathways for the capture and conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). Researchers at the Max-Planck-Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology have developed a synthetic biochemical cycle that directly converts CO2 into the central building block Acetyl-CoA. The researchers were able to implement each of the three cycle modules in the bacterium E.coli, which represents a major step towards realizing synthetic CO2 fixing pathways within the context of living cells.

Developing new ways for the capture and conversion of CO2 is key to tackle the climate emergency. Synthetic biology opens avenues for designing new-to-nature CO2-fixation pathways that capture CO2 more efficiently than those developed by nature. However, realizing those new-to-nature pathways in different in vitro and in vivo systems is still a fundamental challenge. Now, researchers in Tobias Erb's group have designed and constructed a new synthetic CO2-fixation pathway, the so-called THETA cycle. It contains several central metabolites as intermediates, and with the central building block, acetyl-CoA, as its output. This characteristic makes it possible to be divided into modules and integrated into the central metabolism of E. coli.
The entire THETA cycle involves 17 biocatalysts, and was designed around the two fastest CO2-fixing enzymes known to date: crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The researchers found these powerful biocatalysts in bacteria. Although each of the carboxylases can capture CO2 more than 10 times faster than RubisCO, the CO2-fixing enzyme in chloroplasts, evolution itself has not brought these capable enzymes together in natural photosynthesis.
The THETA cycle converts two CO2 molecules into one acetyl-CoA in one cycle. Acetyl-CoA is a central metabolite in almost all cellular metabolism and serves as the building block for a wide array of vital biomolecules, including biofuels, biomaterials, and pharmaceuticals, making it a compound of great interest in biotechnological applications. Upon constructing the cycle in test tubes, the researchers could confirm its functionality. Then the training began: through rational and machine learning-guided optimization over several rounds of experiments, the team was able to improve the acetyl-CoA yield by a factor of 100. In order to test its in vivo feasibility, incorporation into the living cell should be carried out step by step. To this end, the researchers divided the THETA cycle into three modules, each of which was successfully implemented into the bacterium E. coli. The functionality of these modules was verified through growth-coupled selection and/or isotopic labelling.
""What is special about this cycle is that it contains several intermediates that serve as central metabolites in the bacterium's metabolism. This overlap offers the opportunity to develop a modular approach for its implementation."" explains Shanshan Luo, lead author of the study. ""We were able to demonstrate the functionality of the three individual modules in E. coli. However, we have not yet succeeded in closing the entire cycle so that E. coli can grow completely with CO2,"" she adds. Closing the THETA cycle is still a major challenge, as all of the 17 reactions need to be synchronized with the natural metabolism of E. coli, which naturally involves hundreds to thousands of reactions. However, demonstrating the whole cycle in vivo is not the only goal, the researcher emphasizes. ""Our cycle has the potential to become a versatile platform for producing valuable compounds directly from CO2 through extending its output molecule, acetyl-CoA."" says Shanshan Luo.
""Bringing parts of the THETA cycle into living cells is an important proof-of-principle for synthetic biology,"" adds Tobias Erb. ""Such modular implementation of this cycle in E. coli paves the way to the realization of highly complex, orthogonal new-to-nature CO2-fixation pathways in cell factories. We are learning to completely reprogram the cellular metabolism to create a synthetic autotrophic operating system for the cell.""

Here using rational and machine learning-guided optimization approaches, we improved the yield of the cycle by two orders of magnitude and demonstrated the formation of different biochemical building blocks directly from CO2.

Growth-based selection and/or 13C-labelling confirmed the activity of three different modules, demonstrating the first step towards realizing highly orthogonal and complex CO2-fixation pathways in the background of living cells."

Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa need to diversify away from growing maize and switch to crops that are resilient to climate change and supply key micronutrients for the population, say researchers.

Maize is a staple crop across the region where it is grown and consumed in vast quantities. 
Led by Dr Stewart Jennings from the University of Leeds, the study argues that diversification towards fruits, vegetables and crops such as cassava, millet and sorghum will improve nutrition security in the country, with people getting sufficient micronutrients essential for good health.
The study also says the quantity of food produced must increase -- and unless yields are boosted to an unprecedented level, more land will have to be brought into agricultural production.
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to around 1.2 billion people, and according to figures from the World Bank, the population will grow by an additional 740 million people by 2050. 
Farmers will have to boost the amount of food grown at a time when climate change will result in increasingly extreme conditions, affecting what crops can be grown.
The researchers say the population is at risk of ""food and nutrition insecurity"" unless effective ways of adapting to climate change are identified. Integral to any decisions is a requirement that crops need to be nutritious and provide sufficient energy for the population. 
Professor Jennie Macdiarmid, from the Rowett Institute at the University of Aberdeen and one of the authors of the paper, said: ""The study has highlighted the need to place nutrition at the heart of agricultural policy to avoid the long-term unintended consequence of failing to produce food that can deliver the nutritional needs of the population.

""If policy solutions focus only on increasing production of calories and adapting to be climate smart, it is likely there will be negative consequences for health through nutritionally poor diets.""
The study -- Stakeholder-driven transformative adaptation is needed for climate-smart nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa - is published in the scientific journal Nature Food. 
More than 50 researchers contributed to the investigation, which involved talking to policymakers and other stakeholders in the food and agriculture sectors in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia.
'Agriculture and nutrition policies can sit in siloes'
The researchers used the iFEED assessment framework to investigate policy options to create an agricultural system that is resilient to climate change and would supply enough nutritionally-adequate food to meet the food and nutritional needs of the population.
""Too often food, agriculture and nutrition policies sit in siloes across different government departments,"" said Dr Jennings, a Research Fellow in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds. 
""This study provides holistic evidence that combines information on environmental impacts of food system changes and the changes needed for population level nutrition security. The research shows that action can be taken to adapt to climate change and improve nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa."" 

Stakeholders in each country identified key uncertainties in the future of the food system. iFEED explores these uncertain futures and identifies key policy issues that decision makers working in the agriculture and food sectors need to consider. 
The scientists say there needs to be a fundamental shift - or ""transformative approach"" - in agriculture to incorporate nutritional needs. 
Diversifying into soybean production is one option. Soybean crops are more likely to withstand the impacts of climate change compared to maize. Dr Ndashe Kapulu, from the Zambia Agriculture Research Institute and contributing author to the study has been involved in studies to assess how soybean could improve the income of commercial and small-scale farmers.
He said: ""Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa will be better able to handle climate change and other stresses if they have more diverse food systems, such as the transition to soybean production in Zambia.
""As scientists, we need to generate enough evidence in our research to help make changes that support and guide actions to make the agrifood system more resilient.""
Increasing the production and consumption of animal-based products in sub-Saharan Africa could also improve nutritional quality of diets but the scientists warn that it should not reach the unsustainable production levels seen in some higher income countries. 
More animal-based products would cause a rise in greenhouse gas emissions, although the researchers say that this could be tolerable given sub-Saharan Africa's need to reduce the risk of nutritionally-inadequate diets -- and that its greenhouse gas emissions are relatively low.
The study involved researchers from a number of organisation including the University of Leeds, University of Aberdeen, the Met Office, Chatham House and FANRPAN.
iFEED is a database - developed in part by the University of Leeds under the GCRF AFRICAP programme and the CGIAR Initiative on Climate Resilience -- to help decision makers deliver food system policies which are resilient to climate change and deliver nutritious food -- reducing the risk of food and nutrition insecurity.

Yet, to date, few studies have assessed climate-smart agriculture and nutrition security simultaneously. Here we use an integrated assessment framework (iFEED) to explore stakeholder-driven scenarios of food system transformation towards climate-smart nutrition security in Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia. iFEED translates climate–food–emissions modelling into policy-relevant information using model output implication statements. Results show that diversifying agricultural production towards more micronutrient-rich foods is necessary to achieve an adequate population-level nutrient supply by mid-century. Agricultural areas must expand unless unprecedented rapid yield improvements are achieved. While these transformations are challenging to accomplish and often associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions, the alternative for a nutrition-secure future is to rely increasingly on imports, which would outsource emissions and be economically and politically challenging given the large import increases required."

A new iguana joins Asia's rich reptile fauna, officially described as new to science in the open-access journal ZooKeys.

""From 2009 to 2022, we conducted a series of field surveys in South China and collected a number of specimens of the Calotes versicolor species complex, and found that the population of what we thought was Calotes versicolor in South China and Northern Vietnam was a new undescribed species and two subspecies,"" says Yong Huang, whose team described the new species.
Wang's garden lizard (Calotes wangi) is less than 9 cm long, and one of its distinguishing features is its orange tongue.
""Calotes wangi is found in subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests and tropical monsoon forests in southern China and northern Vietnam, mostly in mountainous areas, hills and plains on forest edges, arable land, shrub lands, and even urban green belts. It is active at the edge of the forest, and when it is in danger, it rushes into bushes or climbs tree trunks to hide. Investigations found that the lizards lie on sloping shrub branches at night, sleeping close to the branches,"" says Yong Huang.
It is active from April to October every year, while in the tropics it is active from March to November or even longer, and eats a variety of insects, spiders, and other arthropods.
For now, the researchers estimate that the new species is not threatened, but they do note that in some areas its habitat is fragmented.
""In addition, their bodies are used medicinally and the lizards are also eaten,"" they write in their research paper.
This is why they suggest that the local government strengthen the protection of their ecological environment and pay close attention to the population dynamics.

Low-carbohydrate diets comprised mostly of plant-based proteins and fats with healthy carbohydrates such as whole grains were associated with slower long-term weight gain than low-carbohydrate diets comprised mostly of animal proteins and fats with unhealthy carbohydrates like refined starches, according to a new study led by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The study will be published on December 27, 2023, in JAMA Network Open.
""Our study goes beyond the simple question of, 'To carb or not to carb?'"" said lead author Binkai Liu, research assistant in the Department of Nutrition. ""It dissects the low-carbohydrate diet and provides a nuanced look at how the composition of these diets can affect health over years, not just weeks or months.""
While many studies have shown the benefits of cutting carbohydrates for short-term weight loss, little research has been conducted on low-carbohydrate diets' effect on long-term weight maintenance and the role of food group quality.
Using data from the Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the researchers analyzed the diets and weights of 123,332 healthy adults from as early as 1986 to as recently as 2018. Each participant provided self-reports of their diets and weights every four years. The researchers scored participants' diets based on how well they adhered to five categories of low-carbohydrate diet: total low-carbohydrate diet (TLCD), emphasizing overall lower carbohydrate intake; animal-based low-carbohydrate diet (ALCD), emphasizing animal-based proteins and fats; vegetable-based low-carbohydrate diet (VLCD), emphasizing plant-based proteins and fats; healthy low-carbohydrate diet (HLCD), emphasizing plant-based proteins, healthy fats, and fewer refined carbohydrates; and unhealthy low-carbohydrate diet (ULCD), emphasizing animal-based proteins, unhealthy fats, and carbohydrates coming from unhealthy sources such as processed breads and cereals.
The study found that diets comprised of plant-based proteins and fats and healthy carbohydrates were significantly associated with slower long-term weight gain. Participants who increased their adherence to TLCD, ALCD, and ULCD on average gained more weight compared to those who increased their adherence to HLCD over time. These associations were most pronounced among participants who were younger (<55 years old), overweight or obese, and/or less physically active. The results for the vegetable-based low carbohydrate diet were more ambiguous: Data from the Nurses' Health Study II showed an association between higher VLCD scores and less weight gain over time, while data around VLCD scores from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study were more mixed.
""The key takeaway here is that not all low-carbohydrate diets are created equal when it comes to managing weight in the long-term,"" said senior author Qi Sun, associate professor in the Department of Nutrition. ""Our findings could shake up the way we think about popular low-carbohydrate diets and suggest that public health initiatives should continue to promote dietary patterns that emphasize healthful foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products.""

Data analysis was performed between November 2022 and April 2023. Five LCD indices were examined: (1) a total LCD (TLCD) emphasizing overall lower carbohydrate intake; (2) an animal-based LCD (ALCD) that emphasized animal-sourced protein and fat; (3) a vegetable-based LCD (VLCD) that emphasized plant-sourced protein and fat; (4) a healthy LCD (HLCD) emphasizing less refined carbohydrates, more plant protein, and healthy fat; and (5) an unhealthy LCD (ULCD) emphasizing less healthful carbohydrates, more animal protein, and unhealthy fat.

The median carbohydrate intake (as a percentage of energy) of the highest quintiles of TLCD score at baseline ranged from 38.3% in HPFS to 40.9% in NHSII. Mean weight gain over 4-year intervals among participants varied from 0.8 kg in the HPFS to 1.8 kg in the NHSII.

These findings suggest that the quality of LCDs may play a critical role in modulating long-term weight change. Only LCDs that emphasized high-quality protein, fat, and carbohydrates from whole grains and other plant-based foods were associated with less weight gain."

Forests on the west slope of Oregon's Cascade Range experienced fire much more often between 1500 and 1895 than had been previously thought, according to new research by scientists at Oregon State University.

The findings provide important insight, the authors say, into how landscapes might adapt to climate change and future fire regimes.
James Johnston of the OSU College of Forestry led the study, which was published in Ecosphere.
""Wildland fire is a fundamental forest ecosystem process,"" he said. ""With temperatures rising and more and more area burning, we need to know as much as we can about the long-term variability in fire.""
Johnson and collaborators at Oregon State, the University of Oregon and the U.S. Forest Service gathered tree ring data at 16 sites in the southern part of the Willamette National Forest, in the general vicinity of Oakridge.
Trees form scars after cambial cells are killed by wildfire heat, he said. These scars are partially or completely covered by new tissue as a tree grows, and tree rings tell the story of when the fire exposure occurred.
Using chain saws, the scientists collected samples from 311 dead trees -- logs, short snags and stumps. Seventy-three percent of the samples were coastal Douglas-fir, and 13% were ponderosa pine. The remainder were sugar pine, noble fir, red fir, incense cedar, western red cedar, mountain hemlock and western hemlock.

""We cross-dated a total of 147,588 tree rings and identified 672 cambial injuries, 479 of which were fire scars,"" Johnston said. ""The scars allowed us to reconstruct 130 different fire years that occurred at one or more of the 16 sites before a federal policy of fire suppression went into effect early in the 20th century.""
The main takeaways: Fire was historically far more frequent in western Oregon Cascades landscapes than previously believed. Indigenous peoples likely used fire to manage large areas for resources and probably altered landscapes and fire regimes in significant ways. There are important present-day restoration opportunities for fire-adapted systems in western Oregon.""Also, our study produced little evidence of the kind of large, wind-driven fires that in 2020 burned 50,000 to 75,000 hectares in the watersheds immediately to the north and south of our study area,"" Johnston said. ""Only 39% of fire years were recorded at more than one site, only 11% were recorded at more than two sites, and only 3% at more than three sites -- in a study area of 37,000 acres, that strongly suggests that most historical fires were relatively small.""
Across all 16 sites, the average fire return interval -- the length of time between fires -- was as short as six years and as long as 165. In general the differences in those averages were strongly associated with vapor pressure deficit or VPD, basically the drying power of the atmosphere. The higher the VPD, the shorter the time between fires.
However, historical fire in stands seral to Douglas-fir -- stands that, if left alone, would end up with Douglas-fir as the dominant tree species -- was much less strongly linked with dry air.
""We interpret the extraordinary tempo of fire in those stands, and the climate pattern associated with fire there, to indicate Indigenous fire stewardship,"" Johnston said. ""We saw some of the most frequent fire return intervals ever documented in the Pacific Northwest, but the enormous volume of biomass that these moist forests accumulate over time is often partly attributed to long intervals between wildfire.""
The authors note that humans have occupied the southern part of what is now the Willamette National Forest for at least 10,000 years. A variety of Indigenous cultures, including the Molalla, Kalapuya, Tenino, Wasco, Klamath, Northern Paiute and Cayuse, probably used the area for trading, hunting and the collection of plants.

""Removals happened very quickly, with most Native people taken to the Grand Ronde, Warm Springs and Klamath reservations,"" said co-author David Lewis, a member of the Grand Ronde Tribe and an assistant professor of anthropology and Indigenous studies in OSU's College of Liberal Arts. ""Removal of the tribes took their cultural stewardship practices, their use of annual cultural fires, from the land, radically altering how the forests were managed.""
By 1856, most remaining members of Willamette Valley and western Oregon Cascades tribes had been forcibly removed to reservations. Extensive clearcut logging on the Willamette National Forest started in the late 1940s and continued for four decades.
""Now, Forest Service managers want fine-grained information about forest vegetation and historical disturbance dynamics to manage lands in ways that promote resilience to climate change,"" Johnston said.
He added that the Forest Service is working closely with the Southern Willamette Forest Collaborative, a group based in Oakridge, to plan a variety of restoration treatments.
Joining Johnston and Lewis on the paper were the College of Forestry's Micah Schmidt, now working with the Umatilla Tribe in northeastern Oregon, and Andrew Merschel. Co-authors also included William Downing of the U.S. Forest Service and the University of Oregon's Michael Coughlan.
The Oregon Department of Forestry funded the study.

Here, we describe one of the first annually resolved reconstructions of historical (1500–1900 ce) fire occurrence in coast Douglas‐fir dominated forests of the west slope of the Cascade Range in western Oregon. Mean fire return intervals (MFRIs) across 16 sites within our study area ranged from 6 to 165 years. Variability in MFRIs was strongly associated with average maximum summer vapor pressure deficit. Fire occurred infrequently in Douglas‐fir forest stands seral to mountain hemlock or silver fir, but fire frequency was much shorter than predicted by theory in other forest types. MFRIs within Douglas‐fir stands seral to western hemlock or grand fir ranged from 19 to 45 years, and MFRIs in stands seral to Douglas‐fir ranged from 6 to 11 years. There was little synchrony in fire occurrence or tree establishment across 16 sites separated by 4 km. The lack of synchrony in fire suggests that large, wind‐driven fire events that are often considered to be characteristic of coast Douglas‐fir forests were not an important driver of succession in our study area during the last ~400–500 years. Climate was more arid than normal during fire years in most forest types, but historical fire in stands seral to Douglas‐fir was strongly associated with antecedent moisture and less strongly associated with drought. We interpret the extraordinary tempo of fire we observed in stands seral to Douglas‐fir and the unique climate pattern associated with fire in these stands to be indicative of Indigenous fire stewardship. This study provides evidence of far more frequent historical fire in coast Douglas‐fir forests than assumed by managers or scientists—including some of the most frequent fire return intervals documented in the Pacific Northwest. We recommend additional research across the western Cascades to create a comprehensive account of historical fire in highly productive forests with significant cultural, economic, and ecological importance."

Barley seedlings grow on average 50% more when their root system is stimulated electrically through a new cultivation substrate. In a study published in the journal PNAS, researchers from Linköping University have developed an electrically conductive ""soil"" for soilless cultivation, known as hydroponics.

""The world population is increasing, and we also have climate change. So it's clear that we won't be able to cover the food demands of the planet with only the already existing agricultural methods. But with hydroponics we can grow food also in urban environments in very controlled settings,"" says Eleni Stavrinidou, associate professor at the Laboratory of Organic Electronics at Linköping University, and leader of the Electronic Plants group.
Her research group has now developed an electrically conductive cultivation substrate tailored to hydroponic cultivation which they call eSoil. The Linköping University researchers have shown that barley seedlings grown in the conductive ""soil"" grew up to 50% more in 15 days when their roots were stimulated electrically.
Hydroponic cultivation means that plants grow without soil, needing only water, nutrients and something their roots can attach to -- a substrate. It is a closed system that enables water recirculation so that each seedling gets exactly the nutrients it needs. Therefore, very little water is required and all nutrients remain in the system, which is not possible in traditional cultivation.
Hydroponics also enables vertical cultivation in large towers to maximise space efficiency. Crops already being cultivated in this manner include lettuce, herbs and some vegetables. Grains are not typically grown in hydroponics apart for their use as fodder. In this study the researchers show that barley seedlings can be cultivated using hydroponics and that they have a better growth rate thanks to electrical stimulation.
""In this way, we can get seedlings to grow faster with less resources. We don't yet know how it actually works, which biological mechanisms that are involved. What we have found is that seedlings process nitrogen more effectively, but it's not clear yet how the electrical stimulation impacts this process,"" says Eleni Starvrinidou.
Mineral wool is often used as cultivation substrate in hydroponics. Not only is this non-biodegradable, it is also produced with a very energy intensive process. The electronic cultivation substrate eSoil is made of cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer, mixed with a conductive polymer called PEDOT. This combination as such is not new, but this is the first time it has been used for plant cultivation and for creating an interface for plants in this manner.
Previous research has used high voltage to stimulate the roots. The advantage of the Linköping researchers' ""soil"" is that it has very low energy consumption and no high voltage danger. Eleni Stavrinidou believes that the new study will open the pathway for new research areas to develop further hydroponic cultivation.
""We can't say that hydroponics will solve the problem of food security. But it can definitely help particularly in areas with little arable land and with harsh environmental conditions.""

We demonstrate that barley seedlings that are widely used for fodder grow within the eSoil with the root system integrated within its porous matrix. Simply by polarizing the eSoil, seedling growth is accelerated resulting in increase of dry weight on average by 50% after 15 d of growth. The effect is evident both on root and shoot development and occurs during the growth period after the stimulation. The stimulated plants reduce and assimilate NO 3 − more efficiently than controls, a finding that may have implications on minimizing fertilizer use. However, more studies are required to provide a mechanistic understanding of the physical and biological processes involved. eSoil opens the pathway for the development of active hydroponic scaffolds that may increase crop yield in a sustainable manner."

Crop damage in agriculture and the transmission of vector-borne diseases by insect pests have become a worldwide threat. Chemical treatments such as insecticides and repellents have been a major strategy against insect pests for centuries. Due to limited understanding of mechanisms of insect avoidance behavior, however, development of insect repellents has been delayed. To discover compounds that effectively repel insect pests, it is important to focus on key molecules associated with sensory, particularly aversive, responses. In this study, researchers identified a compound that induces robust aversive responses through multiple sensory pathways in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.

Among sensory receptors, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) cation channels play a key role in nocifensive behaviors to various stimuli in many insect species. Particularly, TRPA1 channel has been extensively studied as it is activated by various hazardous chemicals. Therefore, insect TRPA1 stimulants are promising leads for novel repellents with a broad spectrum. Takaaki Sokabe and his colleagues at the National Institute for Physiological Sciences/the Exploratory Research Center on Life and Living Systems (ExCELLS) found that 2-methylthiazoline (2MT), an analog of a volatile compound found in fox urine, repels flies effectively, and revealed the molecular and cellular mechanisms of 2MT-induced aversions in the fly. They recently published their findings in Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience.
""2MT is reported to evoke innate fear responses in mice via TRPA1, therefore we expected that the chemical possibly have an aversive effect on insects,"" Sokabe says. ""And it worked terrifically more than our expectation.""
Fly's avoidance behaviors revealed that 2MT stimulates multiple sensory modalities: 2MT vapor acts on odorant receptors (ORs) in an olfactory pathway, and direct contact to 2MT activates TRPA1 in taste and nociceptive pathways. This resulted in apparent escaping from chemical source of male flies and avoidance of egg laying of female flies. Furthermore, The researchers demonstrated that TRPA1 is activated by 2MT through the direct interaction of 2MT to specific two amino acids in TRPA1.
""The action of 2MT on multiple sensory pathways seems to be a key for its high effectiveness,"" says Takaaki Sokabe. ""Because the amino acids essential for TRPA1 activation are highly conserved across a wide range of insect species, including agricultural pests and disease vectors, it will be important to test 2MT on many other insect pests to evaluate the spectrum.""
This new work could promote the development of novel insect repellents by focusing on TRP channels and other types of receptors as promising targets.

Considering the crucial role of TRPA1 channels in nocifensive behaviors and aversive responses across various insect species, activators of TRPA1 are promising candidates for insect pest control. In this study, we demonstrate that 2-methylthiazoline (2MT), an artificial volatile thiazoline compound originally identified as a stimulant for mouse TRPA1, can be utilized as a novel repellent for fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. We observed that 2MT induced strong, dose-dependent avoidance behaviors in adult males, regardless of their feeding states, as well as egg laying behavior in females. These aversive responses were mediated by contact chemosensation via TrpA1 and olfaction via odorant receptors. Knocking down TrpA1 revealed the essential roles of bitter taste neurons and nociceptive neurons in the legs and labellum. Furthermore, among five isoforms, TrpA1-C and TrpA1-D exclusively contributed to the aversiveness of 2MT. We also discovered that these isoforms were directly activated by 2MT through covalent modification of evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues. In conclusion, we have identified 2MT as a stimulant for multiple sensory pathways, triggering aversive behaviors in fruit flies. We propose that 2MT and related chemicals may serve as potential resources for developing novel insect repellents."

Tiny things matter -- for instance, one amino acid can completely alter the architecture of the cell. Researchers at the Universities of Göttingen and Warwick investigated the structure and mechanics of the main component of the cytoskeleton of the cell: a protein known as actin. Actin is found in all living cells where it has a range of important functions -- from muscle contraction to cell signalling and cell shape. 

This protein comes in two different varieties termed ""isoforms,"" which are known as gamma actin and beta actin. The difference between the two proteins is miniscule, only a few amino acids at just one part of the molecule vary. Yet this small change has a big impact on the cell. In nature, normally only mixtures of the two isoforms are found. In their study, the researchers separated out the two isoforms and analyzed them individually. The results were published in the journal Nature Communications.
The researchers studied the behaviour of networks of filaments, particularly focusing on the unique properties of the individual isoforms. They employed specialized techniques allowing them to assess the mechanics and dynamics of research models of cytoskeletal networks, drawing on expertise in biophysics at Göttingen and bioengineering at Warwick.
The results indicate that gamma actin prefers to form rigid networks near the cell's apex, while beta actin preferentially forms parallel bundles with a distinct organizational pattern. This difference is likely to be due to the stronger interaction of gamma actin with specific types of positively charged ions, rendering its networks stiffer than those formed by beta actin. ""Our findings are compelling because they open up new avenues for understanding the intricate dynamics of protein networks within cells,"" explains Professor Andreas Janshoff, Institute for Physical Chemistry, University of Göttingen. The research advances scientists' understanding of fundamental cellular processes by shedding light on specific biological functions of actin, and this will have particular relevance for processes involving cellular mechanics such as growth, division and maturation of cells in tissue. ""The implications of these discoveries extend to the broader field of cellular biology, offering insights that could impact many areas of research and applications, for instance in developmental biology,"" adds Janshoff.

We attribute this to selective interactions with Mg2+-ions interconnecting the filaments’ N-termini. Bundling propensity of the isoforms is different in the presence of Mg2+-ions, while crosslinkers such as α-actinin, fascin, and heavy meromyosin alter the mechanical response independent of the isoform. In the presence of myosin, β-actin networks show a large number of small contraction foci, while γ-actin displays larger but fewer foci indicative of a stronger interaction with myosin motors. We infer that subtle changes in the amino acid sequence of actin isoforms lead to alterations of the mechanical properties on the network level with potential implications for specific biological functions."

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a rapidly growing threat to public health. Each year, they account for more than 2.8 million infections, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Without new antibiotics, even common injuries and infections harbor the potential to become lethal.

Scientists are now one step closer to eliminating that threat, thanks to a Texas A&M University-led collaboration that has developed a new family of polymers capable of killing bacteria without inducing antibiotic resistance by disrupting the membrane of these microorganisms.
""The new polymers we synthesized could help fight antibiotic resistance in the future by providing antibacterial molecules that operate through a mechanism against which bacteria do not seem to develop resistance,"" said Dr. Quentin Michaudel, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry and lead investigator in the research, published Dec. 11 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
Working at the interface of organic chemistry and polymer science, the Michaudel Laboratory was able to synthesize the new polymer by carefully designing a positively charged molecule that can be stitched many times to form a large molecule made of the same repeating charged motif using a carefully selected catalyst called AquaMet. According to Michaudel, that catalyst proves key, given that it has to tolerate a high concentration of charges and also be water-soluble -- a feature he describes as uncommon for this type of process.
After achieving success, the Michaudel Lab put its polymers to the test against two main types of antibiotic-resistant bacteria -- E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) -- in collaboration with Dr. Jessica Schiffman's group at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. While awaiting those results, the researchers also tested their polymers' toxicity against human red blood cells.
""A common issue with antibacterial polymers is a lack of selectivity between bacteria and human cells when targeting the cellular membrane,"" Michaudel explained. ""The key is to strike a right balance between effectively inhibiting bacteria growth and killing several types of cells indiscriminately.""
Michaudel credits the multidisciplinary nature of scientific innovation and the generosity of dedicated researchers across the Texas A&M campus and country as factors in his team's success in determining the perfect catalyst for their molecule assembly.

""This project was several years in the making and would not have been possible without the help of several groups, in addition to our UMass collaborators,"" Michaudel said. ""For instance, we had to ship some samples to the Letteri Lab at the University of Virginia to determine the length of our polymers, which required the use of an instrument that few labs in the country have. We are also tremendously grateful to [biochemistry Ph.D. candidate] Nathan Williams and Dr. Jean-Philippe Pellois here at Texas A&M, who provided their expertise in our assessment of toxicity against red blood cells.""
Michaudel says the team will now focus on improving the activity of its polymers against bacteria -- specifically, their selectivity for bacterial cells versus human cells -- before moving on to in vivo assays.
""We are in the process of synthesizing a variety of analogs with that exciting goal in mind,"" he said.

Other key contributors from the Michaudel Lab are chemistry graduate student An Tran '23, postdoctoral scholar Dr. Arunava Maity and former postdoctoral scholar Dr. Nattawut Yuntawattana, who is now an assistant professor of materials science at Kasetsart University in Thailand.
This research was funded primarily by Michaudel's National Institutes of Health Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) through the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.
A native of La Rochelle, France, Michaudel joined the Texas A&M Chemistry faculty in 2018 and holds a joint appointment in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. In addition to an NIH MIRA in 2020, his career honors to date include a 2022 National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award, a 2022 American Chemical Society Polymeric Materials: Science and Engineering (PMSE) Young Investigator Award and a 2021 Thieme Chemistry Journals Award.

Recent studies suggest that the placement of the cationic groups close to the core of the polymeric architecture rather than on appended side chains might improve both their bioactivity and selectivity for bacterial cells over mammalian cells. However, antibacterial main-chain cationic polymers are typically synthesized via polycondensations, which do not afford precise and uniform molecular design. Therefore, accessing main-chain cationic polymers with high degrees of molecular tunability hinges upon the development of controlled polymerizations tolerating cationic motifs (or cation progenitors) near the propagating species. Herein, we report the synthesis and ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of N -methylpyridinium-fused norbornene monomers. The identification of reaction conditions leading to a well-controlled ROMP enabled structural diversification of the main-chain cationic polymers and a study of their bioactivity. This family of polyelectrolytes was found to be active against both Gram-negative ( Escherichia coli ) and Gram-positive (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) bacteria with minimal inhibitory concentrations as low as 25 µg/mL. Additionally, the molar mass of the polymers was found to impact their hemolytic activity with cationic polymers of smaller degrees of polymerization showing increased selectivity for bacteria over human red blood cells."

At about the size of a pinkie nail, the jellyfish species Cladonema can regenerate an amputated tentacle in two to three days -- but how? Regenerating functional tissue across species, including salamanders and insects, relies on the ability to form a blastema, a clump of undifferentiated cells that can repair damage and grow into the missing appendage. Jellyfish, along with other cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones, exhibit high regeneration abilities, but how they form the critical blastema has remained a mystery until now.

A research team based in Japan has revealed that stem-like proliferative cells -- which are actively growing and dividing but not yet differentiating into specific cell types -- appear at the site of injury and help form the blastema.
The findings were published in the scientific journal PLOS Biology.
""Importantly, these stem-like proliferative cells in blastema are different from the resident stem cells localized in the tentacle,"" said corresponding author Yuichiro Nakajima, lecturer in the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Tokyo. ""Repair-specific proliferative cells mainly contribute to the epithelium -- the thin outer layer -- of the newly formed tentacle.""
The resident stem cells that exist in and near the tentacle are responsible for generating all cellular lineages during homeostasis and regeneration, meaning they maintain and repair whatever cells are needed during the jellyfish's lifetime, according to Nakajima. Repair-specific proliferative cells only appear at the time of injury.
""Together, resident stem cells and repair-specific proliferative cells allow rapid regeneration of the functional tentacle within a few days,"" Nakajima said, noting that jellyfish use their tentacles to hunt and feed.
This finding informs how researchers understand how blastema formation differs among different animal groups, according to first author Sosuke Fujita, a postdoctoral researcher in the same lab as Nakajima in the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences.

""In this study, our aim was to address the mechanism of blastema formation, using the tentacle of cnidarian jellyfish Cladonema as a regenerative model in non-bilaterians, or animals that do not form bilaterally -- or left-right -- during embryonic development,"" Fujita said, explaining that the work may provide insight from an evolutionary perspective.
Salamanders, for example, are bilaterian animals capable of regenerating limbs. Their limbs contain stem cells restricted to specific cell-type needs, a process that appears to operate similarly to the repair-specific proliferative cells observed in the jellyfish.
""Given that repair-specific proliferative cells are analogues to the restricted stem cells in bilaterian salamander limbs, we can surmise that blastema formation by repair-specific proliferative cells is a common feature independently acquired for complex organ and appendage regeneration during animal evolution,"" Fujita said.
The cellular origins of the repair-specific proliferative cells observed in the blastema remain unclear, though, and the researchers say the currently available tools to investigate the origins are too limited to elucidate the source of those cells or to identify other, different stem-like cells.
""It would be essential to introduce genetic tools that allow the tracing of specific cell lineages and the manipulation in Cladonema,"" Nakajima said. ""Ultimately, understanding blastema formation mechanisms in regenerative animals, including jellyfish, may help us identify cellular and molecular components that improve our own regenerative abilities.""

While bilaterians have diversified blastema formation methods, its mechanisms in non-bilaterians remain poorly understood. Cnidarian jellyfish, or medusae, represent early-branching metazoans that exhibit complex morphology and possess defined appendage structures highlighted by tentacles with stinging cells (nematocytes). Here, we investigate the mechanisms of tentacle regeneration, using the hydrozoan jellyfish Cladonema pacificum. We show that proliferative cells accumulate at the tentacle amputation site and form a blastema composed of cells with stem cell morphology. Nucleoside pulse-chase experiments indicate that most repair-specific proliferative cells (RSPCs) in the blastema are distinct from resident stem cells. We further demonstrate that resident stem cells control nematogenesis and tentacle elongation during both homeostasis and regeneration as homeostatic stem cells, while RSPCs preferentially differentiate into epithelial cells in the newly formed tentacle, analogous to lineage-restricted stem/progenitor cells observed in salamander limbs. Taken together, our findings propose a regeneration mechanism that utilizes both resident homeostatic stem cells (RHSCs) and RSPCs, which in conjunction efficiently enable functional appendage regeneration, and provide novel insight into the diversification of blastema formation across animal evolution."

A lot has changed in the world since the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted 50 years ago in December 1973.

Two researchers at The Ohio State University were among a group of experts invited by the journal Science to discuss how the ESA has evolved and what its future might hold.
Tanya Berger-Wolf, faculty director of Ohio State's Translational Data Analytics Institute, led a group that wrote on ""Sustainable, trustworthy, human-technology partnership."" Amy Ando, professor and chair of the university's Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics, wrote on ""Harnessing economics for effective implementation.""
Berger-Wolf and her colleagues wrote, ""We are in the middle of a mass extinction without even knowing all that we are losing and how fast."" But technology can help address that.
For example, they note the value of tools like camera traps that survey animal species and smartphone apps that allow citizen scientists to count insects, identify bird songs and report plant observations.
New tech has allowed scientists to monitor animal and plant populations at scale for the first time, said Berger-Wolf, who is also a professor of computer science and engineering, evolution, ecology and organismal biology, and electrical and computer engineering. One challenge is to find new ways to extract all the information from these new sources of data.
""But even with all this data, we are still monitoring only a tiny fraction of the biodiversity out in the world,"" she said. ""Without that information, we don't know what we have, how different species are doing and whether our policies to protect endangered species are working.""
Most important, Berger-Wolf said, is the need to make sure to keep humans in the process. Technology needs to connect data, connect different regions of the world, connect people to nature and connect people to people.

""We don't want to sever the connection between people and nature, we want to strengthen it,"" she said.
""We cannot rely on technology to save the world's biodiversity. It has to be an intentional partnership between humans and technology and AI.""
Economics should be another partner in the fight to save endangered species, Ando said.
""There's this tendency to think that protecting endangered species is all about biology and ecology,"" Ando said. ""But various tools in economics are very helpful in making sure the work we do to implement the Endangered Species Act is successful. That is not always obvious to people.""
For example, bioeconomic research is a multidisciplinary effort between economists and biologists to work together to see how human behavior interacts with ecological processes and systems.
""We have to take into account feedback effects. People take an action, and that changes the ecosystem and that changes what people do,"" she said. ""We need to capture those feedback effects.""
The result can be novel ways to protect endangered species, such as ""pop-up"" habitat modification. For example, ranchers can take down fences temporarily while elk are migrating to allow them to move freely. Rice fields can be temporarily flooded during shorebird migration to give them a place to rest and feed on their travels.

We can ""draw upon economics to optimize the timing, location and extent of temporary actions to maximize their net benefits to society,"" Ando wrote in Science.
Another way economics can help is to develop policies that protect species before they become so threatened that they need ESA protection.
A common issue is that multiple landowners will all need to work together to protect the habitat of threatened species. But often, if some landowners take actions to protect a species, other landowners will think they don't have to.
""Economists have been working to understand how we can coordinate landowners where we don't have to implement draconian land use regulations, but still protect habitat,"" Ando said.
""That is a very promising tactic that can protect species and also reduce the cost to people of doing so.""

Yet human pressures continue to push the planet toward extinctions on a massive scale.

Mayo Clinic researchers mapped how the measles virus mutated and spread in the brain of a person who succumbed to a rare, lethal brain disease. New cases of this disease, which is a complication of the measles virus, may occur as measles reemerges among the unvaccinated, say researchers.

Using the latest tools in genetic sequencing, researchers at Mayo Clinic reconstructed how a collective of viral genomes colonized a human brain. The virus acquired distinct mutations that drove the spread of the virus from the frontal cortex outward.
""Our study provides compelling data that shows how viral RNA mutated and spread throughout a human organ -- the brain, in this case,"" says Roberto Cattaneo, Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic virologist who is a co-lead author on a new PLOS Pathogens study. ""Our discoveries will help studying and understanding how other viruses persist and adapt to the human brain, causing disease. This knowledge may facilitate the generation of effective antiviral drugs.""
What is measles?
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases. The measles virus infects the upper respiratory tract where it uses the trachea, or windpipe, as a trampoline to launch and spread through droplets dispersed when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
Dr. Cattaneo pioneered studies on how the measles virus spreads throughout the body.
He first began to study the measles virus about 40 years ago and was fascinated by the rare, lethal brain disease called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), which occurs in about 1 in every 10,000 measles cases. It can take about five to 10 years after the initial infection for the measles virus to mutate and spread throughout the brain. Symptoms of this progressive neurological disease include memory loss, seizures and immobility. Dr. Cattaneo studied SSPE for several years until the lethal disease nearly disappeared as more people were vaccinated against measles.

However, measles is resurging due to vaccine hesitancy and missed vaccinations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of children missed receiving their measles vaccinations, which has resulted in an estimated 18% increase in measles cases and 43% increase in death from measles in 2021 compared to 2022 worldwide, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report.
""We suspect SSPE cases will rise again as well. This is sad because this horrible disease can be prevented by vaccination. But now we are in the position to study SSPE with modern, genetic sequencing technology and learn more about it,"" says Iris Yousaf, co-lead author of the study and a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.
Dr. Cattaneo and Yousaf had a unique research opportunity through a collaboration with the CDC. They studied the brain of a person who had contracted measles as a child and had succumbed to SSPE years later as an adult. They investigated 15 specimens from different regions of the brain and conducted genetic sequencing on each region to piece together the puzzle of how the measles virus mutated and spread.
The researchers discovered that, after the measles virus entered the brain, its genome -- the complete set of genetic material for the virus -- began to change in harmful ways. The genome replicated, creating other genomes that were slightly different. Then, these genomes replicated again -- resulting in more genomes that were each a little different as well. The virus did this multiple times, creating a population of varied genomes.
""In this population, two specific genomes had a combination of characteristics that worked together to promote virus spread from the initial location of the infection -- the frontal cortex of the brain -- out to colonize the entire organ,"" says Dr. Cattaneo.
The next steps in this research are to understand how specific mutations favor virus spread in the brain. These studies will be done in cultivated brain cells and in clusters of cells resembling the brain called organoids. This knowledge may help in creating effective antiviral drugs to combat virus spread in the brain. However, pharmacological intervention in advanced disease stages is challenging. Preventing SSPE through measles vaccination remains the best method.

However, genetic characterization of the spatial dynamics of collective infectious units in animal hosts is demanding, and it is rarely feasible in humans. Measles virus (MeV), whose spread in lymphatic tissues and airway epithelia relies on collective infectious units, can, in rare cases, cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a lethal human brain disease. In different SSPE cases, MeV acquisition of brain tropism has been attributed to mutations affecting either the fusion or the matrix protein, or both, but the overarching mechanism driving brain adaptation is not understood. Here we analyzed MeV RNA from several spatially distinct brain regions of an individual who succumbed to SSPE. Surprisingly, we identified two major MeV genome subpopulations present at variable frequencies in all 15 brain specimens examined. Both genome types accumulated mutations like those shown to favor receptor-independent cell-cell spread in other SSPE cases. Most infected cells carried both genome types, suggesting the possibility of genetic complementation. We cannot definitively chart the history of the spread of this virus in the brain, but several observations suggest that mutant genomes generated in the frontal cortex moved outwards as a collective and diversified. During diversification, mutations affecting the cytoplasmic tails of both viral envelope proteins emerged and fluctuated in frequency across genetic backgrounds, suggesting convergent and potentially frequency-dependent evolution for modulation of fusogenicity. We propose that a collective infectious unit drove MeV pathogenesis in this brain. Re-examination of published data suggests that similar processes may have occurred in other SSPE cases. Our studies provide a primer for analyses of the evolution of collective infectious units of other pathogens that cause lethal disease in humans."

Through an international collaboration, scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital leveraged data science, pharmacology and structural information to conduct an atomic-level investigation into how each amino acid in the receptor that binds adrenaline contributes to receptor activity in the presence of this natural ligand. They discovered precisely which amino acids control the key pharmacological properties of the ligand. The adrenaline receptor studied is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, and this family is the target of one-third of all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Thus, understanding how GPCRs respond to natural or therapeutic ligands is critical for developing new therapies with precise effects on receptor activity. The work was published today in Science.

To understand how a watch works, one might take it apart, piece by piece, and study the role played by each component in its timekeeping function. Similarly, in a protein such as a GPCR, each amino acid might play a different role in how the protein responds to an external signal. Researchers at St. Jude, in collaboration with scientists from Stanford University, the University of Montreal, the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Cambridge University, investigated the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) by substituting one amino acid at a time to understand the contribution of each amino acid in this receptor to mediate a signaling response.
""Scientists learn how genes contribute to cell function by disrupting them one at a time. We asked, 'Why don't we take this one level deeper? Let's understand how every amino acid contributes to the functioning of a receptor by mutating them, one amino acid at a time,'"" said co-corresponding author M. Madan Babu, PhD, from St. Jude's Department of Structural Biology, Center of Excellence for Data-Driven Discovery director and the George J. Pedersen Endowed Chair in Biological Data Science. ""Through evolution, every amino acid in the receptor has been sculpted in some way or another to ensure that it binds the natural ligand, in this case adrenaline, and elicits the appropriate physiological response.""
Finding function in the form
GPCRs are proteins that span the cell's membrane and connect the outside of the cell to its internal environment by transmitting external signals to the inside of the cell. In the case of the β2AR, adrenaline binds to the GPCR on the part outside of the cell, inducing a response inside the cell.
When a ligand binds, it causes changes in the shape of the receptor, especially in the intracellular region of the receptor where a G protein binds. The binding sites for the ligand and the G protein are on opposite sides of the protein but connect through a complex network of amino acid contacts that span the entire protein. Conformational (shape) changes within the GPCR activate the G protein to trigger a downstream signaling response within the cell. Through effects on multiple tissues and GPCRs, including the β2AR, adrenaline can trigger the fight-or-flight response, such as during an adrenaline surge.
To understand the role of each amino acid in a GPCR, Franziska Heydenreich, PhD, now of the Philipps University of Marburg, the lead and co-corresponding author of this project, mutated each of the 412 amino acids in the β2AR. She then evaluated each mutant's response to the ligand adrenaline and determined the classical pharmacological properties of efficacy and potency. Efficacy measures the maximum response a ligand can elicit, and potency measures the amount of ligand required to elicit half of the maximum response. The aim was to reveal, on an atomic scale, how each amino acid contributes to these pharmacological properties.

""Surprisingly, only about 80 of the more than 400 amino acids contributed to these pharmacological properties. Of these pharmacologically relevant amino acids, only one-third were located within regions where the ligand or G protein bound to the receptor,"" Heydenreich said.
""It was fascinating to observe that there are some amino acids that control efficacy, some that control potency and then there are others that affect both,"" Babu said. ""It means if you want to make a more potent or efficacious drug, you now know there are specific residues that the new ligand needs to influence."" The researchers also noted that the individual contribution of each residue to efficacy and potency was not equal, implying even more opportunities for fine-tuning drug responses while designing new therapeutic ligands.
""Efficacy and potency have been measured for numerous ligand-receptor signaling systems for several decades. Now we can understand how specific amino acids in a protein's sequence can influence these pharmacological properties,"" Babu explained.
""A fascinating aspect of the results is that potency and efficacy can be regulated independently of each other through distinct mechanisms. This provides a basis for understanding how genetic variation influences drug responses among individuals,"" Michel Bouvier, PhD, co-corresponding author from the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine and General Director of the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer of the University of Montreal added.
A beautiful network
Prior research illustrated the structure of both the active and inactive states of the β2AR. Building on this knowledge, the researchers embarked on a new investigation. They explored whether the two-thirds of pharmacologically relevant amino acids previously demonstrated to be not involved in ligand or G-protein binding might play a role in the transition between the active and inactive states of the receptor.

""We systematically started looking at every residue contact unique to the active state,"" Heydenreich said, ""to understand whether all the amino acids that make an active-state contact are important.""
The researchers developed a data science framework to integrate pharmacological and structural data systematically and revealed the first comprehensive picture of GPCR signaling. ""When we mapped the pharmacological data onto the structure, they formed a beautiful network,"" said Babu.
""It provided new insights into the allosteric network linking the ligand binding pocket to the G protein binding site that governs efficacy and potency."" Added Brian Kobilka, co-corresponding author and the 2012 Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry from Stanford University School of Medicine.
By understanding GPCR signaling at the atomic level, the researchers are optimistic that they can begin probing even deeper -- to see the transient sub-states between the active and inactive conformations and to explore the conformational landscape of proteins.
""We now know which mutants to go after, those that only affect efficacy, potency or both,"" Heydenreich said.
""Now, we can perform molecular dynamics calculations and single-molecule experiments on those mutants to reveal the exact mechanisms by which the allosteric network influences efficacy and potency to mediate a signaling response. This is a direction we are pursuing through a St. Jude Research Collaborative on GPCRs that includes PIs from several institutions."" Babu explained.
Apart from these ""driver"" residues that are involved in mediating active state-specific contacts and affect pharmacology when mutated, Babu and his colleagues intend to probe other key findings revealed by this work. They aim to study ""passenger"" amino acids that, despite making contacts in the active state, do not affect efficacy or potency when mutated. They are also interested in ""modulator"" residues that don't mediate active state-specific contacts but alter pharmacology when mutated. Their data science approach, integrating structural information and pharmacological measurements, isn't limited to the β2AR. It can be extended to any GPCR to enhance our understanding of the mechanics governing this crucial class of drug targets.

We used the prototypical adrenaline–β2 adrenergic receptor–G protein system to reveal how specific receptor residues decode and translate the information encoded in a ligand to mediate a signaling response. We present a data science framework to integrate pharmacological and structural data to uncover structural changes and allosteric networks relevant for ligand pharmacology.

A new study led by scientists at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History identifies five new species of soft-furred hedgehogs from Southeast Asia.

The study, published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, used DNA analysis and physical characteristics to describe two entirely new species of soft-furred hedgehogs and elevate three subspecies to the level of species.
The two new species, named Hylomys vorax and H. macarong, are endemic to the endangered Leuser ecosystem, a tropical rainforest in North Sumatra and Southern Vietnam, respectively. The museum specimens that were vital to describing these two new species came from the natural history collections of the Smithsonian and the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia where they had remained in drawers for 84 and 62 years, respectively, prior to identification.
The study -- an international collaboration between researchers at the University of Seville and the Doñana Biological Station in Spain, George Mason University and the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in the U.S., the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum in Singapore, the Natural History Museum of Geneva in Switzerland and the University of Malaya in Malaysia -- highlights that even in well-studied animal groups like mammals there are still discoveries waiting to be made, showing what is possible when modern techniques such as DNA analysis are applied to museum collections.
Soft-furred hedgehogs or gymnures are small mammals that are members of the hedgehog family, but as their common name suggests they are furry rather than spiny. Like spiny hedgehogs, they are not rodents and they have a pointy snout. Without the spines of their more well-known cousins, soft-furred hedgehogs superficially look a bit like a mixture of a mouse and a shrew with a short tail, said Arlo Hinckley, the study's lead author and a Margarita Salas Postdoctoral Fellow at the National Museum of Natural History and University of Seville. The five new species belong to a group of soft-furred hedgehogs called lesser gymnures (Hylomys) that live in Southeast Asia and previously was only recognized to have been represented by two known species.
""We were only able to identify these new hedgehogs thanks to museum staff that curated these specimens across countless decades and their original field collectors,"" Hinckley said. ""By applying modern genomic techniques like we did many years after these hedgehogs were first collected, the next generation will be able to identify even more new species.""
Hinckley said these small mammals are active during the day and night and are omnivorous, likely eating a diversity of insects and other invertebrates as well as some fruits as opportunities present themselves.

""Based on the lifestyles of their close relatives and field observations, these hedgehogs likely nest in hollows and take cover while foraging among tree roots, fallen logs, rocks, grassy areas, undergrowth and leaf litter,"" Hinckley said. ""But, because they're so understudied, we are limited to speculate about the details of their natural history.""
Hinckley first became intrigued with the gymnure group Hylomys in 2016 during his doctoral studies, especially after he sampled them in Borneo with co-author Miguel Camacho Sánchez. Preliminary genetic data and studies of several known populations of Hylomys in Southeast Asia suggested to them there might be more species in the group than were currently recognized. This sent Hinckley combing through natural history collections searching for specimens assigned to the group, many of which were only preserved skins and skulls.
When he began his research at the Smithsonian in 2022, Hinckley leveraged the National Museum of Natural History's collections to fill in geographic gaps in the specimens he had already studied with the help of Melissa Hawkins, the museum's curator of mammals.
In the end, Hinckley, Hawkins and their collaborators assembled 232 physical specimens and 85 tissue samples for genetic analysis from across the entire Hylomys group from a combination of Hinckley and Hawkins' own field collecting, as well as modern and historical museum specimens from no less than 14 natural history collections across Asia, Europe and the U.S.
Then Hinckley and his co-authors set about the lengthy process of conducting genetic analysis on the 85 tissue samples in Doñana Biological Station's ancient DNA laboratory and the museum's Laboratories of Analytical Biology. They also made rigorous physical observations and collected measurements to examine differences in the size and shape of skulls, teeth and fur on the 232 specimens.
The genetic results identified seven distinct genetic lineages in Hylomys, suggesting the number of recognized species in the group was about to increase by five, later confirmed by the team's physical observations of the specimens.

""It might be surprising for people to hear that there are still undiscovered mammals out there,"" Hawkins said. ""But there is a lot we don't know -- especially the smaller nocturnal animals that can be difficult to tell apart from one another.""
H. macarong, which has dark brown fur and measures about 14 centimeters (5.5 inches) in length, was named after a Vietnamese word for vampire (Ma cà r?ng) because males of the species possess long, fang-like incisors. Hinckley said more field study would be required to figure out what purpose the fangs might serve, but that their larger size in males suggests they could have some role in sexual selection. Males also have rust-colored chest markings that Hawkins said could have been stained by scent glands.
H. vorax also has dark brown fur but is slightly smaller than H. macarong at 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) long; it has a completely black tail, a very narrow snout and is found only on the slopes of Mount Leuser in Northern Sumatra. Hinckley and Hawkins gave the species the Latin name H. vorax after a striking description of its behavior from mammologist Frederick Ulmer, who collected the specimens that led to the species description on an expedition to Sumatra in 1939. Ulmer described the creature in his field notes, incorrectly identifying it as a type of shrew: ""They were voracious beasts often devouring the whole bait before springing the trap. Ham rind, coconut, meat, and walnuts were eaten. One shrew partially devoured the chicken head bait of a steel trap before getting caught in a nearby Schuyler trap baited with ham rind.""
The other three new species were all formerly considered to be subspecies of Hylomys suillus, but all showed sufficient genetic and physical divergence to merit the upgrade to species in their own right. They are named H. dorsalis, H. maxi and H. peguensis.
H. dorsalis hails from the mountains of Northern Borneo and features a conspicuous dark stripe that begins atop its head and bisects its back before fading around mid-body. It is about the same size as H. macarong. H. maxi is also on the larger end of the new species of soft-furred hedgehogs at 14 centimeters (5.5 inches). The species is found in mountainous regions on the Malay Peninsula and in Sumatra. H. peguensis is smaller, measuring 13 centimeters (5.1 inches), and is found in numerous countries in mainland Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. Its fur is a bit more yellow colored than that of the other new species, Hawkins said.
Describing new species expands humanity's scientific understanding of the natural world can be a tool for boosting conservation in threatened habitats such as Northern Sumatra's Leuser ecosystem.
""This kind of study can help governments and organizations make hard choices about where to prioritize conservation funding to maximize biodiversity,"" Hinckley said.
This research was supported by the Smithsonian, Spain's Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness as well as its Ministry of Universities, the European Union and Harvard University.

Our research emphasizes the importance of scientific collections and underscores the potential of museum genomics and additional field sampling to identify new species and improve our understanding of species diversity in poorly studied regions. Speciation events within Hylomys occurred during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene, possibly driven by shifting climate conditions such as the strengthening of the Indian monsoon and the expansion of seasonally dry conditions. This study supports northern Sumatra and the southern Annamites as centres of localized endemicity and suggests the need for additional small mammal surveys across Sumatra’s Barisan Range."

Species throughout the animal kingdom feature vital interfaces between the outermost layers of their bodies and the environment. Intricate microscopic structures -- featured on the outer skin layers of humans, as one example -- are known to assemble in matrix patterns.

But how these complex structures, known as apical extracellular matrices (aECMs) are assembled into elaborately woven architectures has remained an elusive question.
Now, following years of research and the power of a technologically advanced instrument, University of California San Diego scientists have unraveled the underpinnings of such matrices in a tiny nematode. The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied extensively for decades due to its transparent structure that allows researchers to peer inside its body and examine its skin.
Described in the journal Nature Communications, School of Biological Sciences researchers have now deciphered the assemblage of aECM patterns in roundworms at the nanoscale. A powerful, super-resolution microscope helped reveal previously unseen patterns related to columns, known as struts, that are key to the proper development and functioning of aECMs.
""Struts are like tiny pillars that connect the different layers of the matrix and serve as a type of scaffolding,"" said Andrew Chisholm, a professor in the School of Biological Sciences and the paper's senior author.
Although roundworms serve as a model organism for laboratory studies due to their simple, transparent bodies, below the surface they feature intricate architectures. They also have nearly 20,000 genes, not unlike the number of human genes, and therefore provide lessons on structure and function of more advanced organisms.
Focusing on the roundworm exoskeleton known as the cuticle, the researchers found that defects in struts result in unnatural layer swelling, or ""blistering."" Within the cuticle layer, the research study focused on collagens, which are the most abundant family of proteins in our bodies and help keep bodily materials conjoined.
""The struts hold the critical layers together,"" said Chisholm. ""Without them, the layers separate and cause disorders such as blistering. In blistering mutants you don't see any struts.""
Conventional laboratory instruments had previously imaged struts without detail, often resulting in undefined blobs. But through Biological Sciences Assistant Professor Andreas Ernst's laboratory they accessed advanced instrumentation -- known as 3D-structured illumination super resolution microscopy (3D-SIM) -- which put the struts into stunning focus and allowed their functions to be more easily defined. The researchers were then able to solve the nanoscale organization of struts and previously undocumented levels of patterning in the cuticle layer.
""We could see exactly where these proteins were going in the matrix,"" said Chisholm. ""This is potentially a paradigm for how the matrix assembles into very complex structures and very intricate patterning.""

In the adult C. elegans cuticle, layers are connected by regularly spaced columnar structures known as struts. Defects in struts result in swelling of the fluid-filled medial cuticle layer (‘blistering’, Bli). Here we show that three cuticle collagens BLI-1, BLI-2, and BLI-6, play key roles in struts. BLI-1 and BLI-2 are essential for strut formation whereas activating mutations in BLI-6 disrupt strut formation. BLI-1, BLI-2, and BLI-6 precisely colocalize to arrays of puncta in the adult cuticle, corresponding to struts, initially deposited in diffuse stripes adjacent to cuticle furrows. They eventually exhibit tube-like morphology, with the basal ends of BLI-containing struts contact regularly spaced holes in the cuticle. Genetic interaction studies indicate that BLI strut patterning involves interactions with other cuticle components. Our results reveal strut formation as a tractable example of precise aECM patterning at the nanoscale."

For many of us, when we think of microbiomes, our first thoughts are probably about the beneficial microorganisms that live in our guts. But now, researchers from Japan and US have discovered how the microbes living in fruit flies can enhance their reproduction.

In a recently published study in Communications Biology, the research group has revealed that microbes in the fruit fly microbiome are involved in controlling the germline stem cells that form eggs, as well as subsequent egg maturation, in female fruit flies.
The microbiome -- the community of microorganisms that live together in and on a host -- has a huge role in facilitating functions that are necessary for survival. This includes metabolic regulation, intake of nutrients, and reproduction, including improving fertility in conditions of inadequate nutrition. However, the specific molecular mechanisms enabling microbes to control the maturation of the germline (the lineage of cells within an organism that gives rise to eggs and sperms) are still a mystery.
""We propose that microbes control various stages of oogenesis, which leads the production of eggs in the ovary,"" says lead author of the study Ritsuko Suyama. ""They may do this by modifying hormone levels and their successive pathways and can therefore promote host fertility in conditions of poor nutrition.""
The researchers investigated the effects of microbes on oogenesis in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. Using genetic analysis, the team revealed that microbes boost oogenesis by both accelerating the division of ovarian cells and suppressing programmed cell death, as well as increasing the production of germline stem cells (GSC) by enhanced cell division and eventually increasing the number of mature eggs in females.
""We discovered that the microbes' enhancement of reproductive function was controlled by the activation of the hormonal pathways for ecdysone and juvenile hormones in the germline stem cells -- the cells that develop into eggs,"" explains Toshie Kai, senior author.
Ecdysone is a steroid hormone that regulates moulting in insects. The researchers found that the ecdysone pathway may be an important mediator for a microbe-induced increase of GSCs and egg maturation. Meanwhile, the juvenile hormone pathway is involved only in GSC proliferation, which indicates that the hormonal pathways are activated during different stages of oogenesis.
""Our results show that environmental microbes can improve host reproduction by controlling hormone release and increasing oogenesis in their hosts,"" says Suyama.
These new discoveries about host-microbe interactions could present new avenues for improvements in reproductive health, for example via new treatments involving probiotics. Specifically, the findings from this study will contribute to the understanding of how microbes boost their host's reproductive processes, which will open the door for new methods to improve fertility and infertility treatment.

Among these factors, microbes facilitate vital functions for host animals such as nutritional intake, metabolic regulation, and enhancing fertility under poor nutrition conditions. However, detailed molecular mechanisms by which microbes control germline maturation, leading to reproduction, remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that environmental microbes exert a beneficial effect on Drosophila oogenesis by promoting germline stem cell (GSC) proliferation and subsequent egg maturation via acceleration of ovarian cell division and suppression of apoptosis. Moreover, insulin-related signaling is not required; rather, the ecdysone pathway is necessary for microbe-induced increase of GSCs and promotion of egg maturation, while juvenile hormone contributes only to increasing GSC numbers, suggesting that hormonal pathways are activated at different stages of oogenesis. Our findings reveal that environmental microbes can enhance host reproductivity by modulating host hormone release and promoting oogenesis."

In a breakthrough discovery, published in Nature Communications, scientists from Queen Mary University of London in collaboration with researchers at Newcastle University and The Francis Crick Institute have unraveled the intricate mechanism behind how DnaA, the master initiator of DNA replication in bacteria, specifically opens replication origins, the gateways to DNA duplication. This fundamental understanding sheds light on the crucial process that underpins the growth and reproduction of nearly all bacterial cells.

In this multi-disciplinary work employing single-molecule TIRF microscopy, chemical biology and structural biology, Dr Aravindan Ilangovan, Reader in Structural Biology, and his team at School of Biological and Behavioural Sciences of Queen Mary unveiled the molecular dance of DnaA at the replication origin using cryo-electron microscopy, in detail to near atomic resolution. Their findings reveal a previously unknown dinucleotide binding pocket within the DnaA oligomer, where two bases of a repeating DnaA-trio sequence tightly bind, enabling the capture of a single DNA strand.
""This key single DNA strand capture is the critical step that allows DnaA to pry open the DNA duplex, paving the way for the initiation of DNA replication,"" explained Dr Ilangovan. ""Our work provides a molecular blueprint for how DnaA orchestrates this crucial step in bacterial replication, a fundamental process that underpins life itself.""
This study's findings deepen our understanding of DNA replication and hold the potential for therapeutic applications. By targeting the specific interactions between DnaA and the replication origin, researchers could develop novel approaches towards tackling untreatable bacterial infections. Antibiotic resistance is on the rise and there is an ever-increasing need for novel antibiotics to tackle this current crisis.
""This groundbreaking discovery significantly advances our understanding of bacterial replication, a fundamental process crucial for life. The unique mechanism we have unraveled presents a compelling target for developing new antibiotics, potentially leading to novel treatments for multi-antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. We continue to delve deeper into the intricate dance of DNA replication, paving the way for further breakthroughs in understanding bacterial cell biology and combating antibiotic resistance,"" concludes Dr Ilangovan.

In bacteria, DNA replication is initiated by the ubiquitous DnaA protein, which assembles into an oligomeric complex at the chromosome origin (oriC) that engages both double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to promote DNA duplex opening. However, the mechanism of DnaA specifically opening a replication origin was unknown. Here we show that Bacillus subtilis DnaAATP assembles into a continuous oligomer at the site of DNA melting, extending from a dsDNA anchor to engage a single DNA strand. Within this complex, two nucleobases of each ssDNA binding motif (DnaA-trio) are captured within a dinucleotide binding pocket created by adjacent DnaA proteins. These results provide a molecular basis for DnaA specifically engaging the conserved sequence elements within the bacterial chromosome origin basal unwinding system (BUS)."

Finding and describing new species can be a tricky endeavor. Scientists typically look for distinctive characters that can differentiate one species from another. However, variation is a continuum that is not always easy to quantify. At one extreme, multiple species can look alike even though they are different species -- these are known as cryptic species. At the other extreme, a single species can be highly variable, creating an illusion of being different species. But what happens when you encounter both extremes simultaneously?

Herpetologist Dr Chan Kin Onn (previously at the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, Singapore, now with the University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute and Natural History Museum, USA) led a study describing a new species of pit viper from Myanmar that is both similar and different from its sister species. The discovery is published in the open-access journal ZooKeys.
""Asian pit vipers of the genus Trimeresurus are notoriously difficult to tell apart, because they run the gamut of morphological variation. Some groups contain multiple species that look alike, while others may look very different but are actually the same species,"" they say.
The redtail pit viper (Trimeresurus erythrurus) occurs along the northern coast of Myanmar and is invariably green with no markings on its body. A different species called the mangrove pit viper (Trimeresurus purpureomaculatus) occurs in southern Myanmar. This species typically has distinct dorsal blotches, and incredibly variable dorsal coloration including gray, yellow, brown, and black, but never green. Interestingly, in central Myanmar, sandwiched between the distribution of the redtail pit viper and the mangrove pit viper, a unique population exists that is green with varying degrees of blotchiness, which appears to be a blend between the redtail pit viper and the mangrove pit viper.
""This mysterious population in central Myanmar baffled us and we initially thought that it could be a hybrid population,"" the researchers said. In a separate paper, Dr Chan used modern genomic techniques and determined that the population in central Myanmar was actually a distinct species and not a hybrid population.
But this was not the end of the story. The researchers discovered another surprise when they examined the snake's morphological features: they found that the new species was also highly variable. Certain populations are dark green with distinct blotches, easily distinguishable from its closest relative, the redtail pit viper, which is bright green with no blotches. However, some populations of the new species are bright green with no blotches and look virtually identical to the redtail pit viper.
""This is an interesting phenomenon, where one species is simultaneously similar and different from its closest relative (the redtail pit viper). We think that at some point in the past, the new species may have exchanged genes with the redtail pit viper from the north and the mangrove pit viper from the south,"" says Dr Chan.
The new species is called the Ayeyarwady pit viper (Trimeresurus ayeyarwadyensis) in reference to the Ayeyarwady River, which is the largest and one of the most important rivers in Myanmar. The river forms an expansive delta that is bounded by the Pathein River to the west and the Yangon River to the east. These rivers and their associated basins also mark the westernmost and easternmost distribution boundaries of the Ayeyarwady pit viper.

The new species, Trimeresurus ayeyarwadyensissp. nov., is most closely related to T. erythrurus and T. purpureomaculatus and shares morphological characteristics with both of those species. Some specimens of T. ayeyarwadyensissp. nov. have green dorsal coloration and no distinct dorsal blotches (a trait shared with T. erythrurus but not T. purpureomaculatus), while others have dark dorsal blotches (a trait shared with T. purpureomaculatus but not T. erythrurus). The distinct evolutionary trajectory of the new species, coupled with the lack of obvious morphological differentiation, represents a classic example of the cryptic nature of species commonly found in the Trimeresurus group of Asian pit-vipers and underscores the need for data-rich analyses to verify species’ boundaries more broadly within this genus."

A groundbreaking new technique invented by researchers at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Science may revolutionize the field of synthetic biology. Known as CReATiNG (Cloning Reprogramming and Assembling Tiled Natural Genomic DNA), the method offers a simpler and more cost-effective approach to constructing synthetic chromosomes. It could significantly advance genetic engineering and enable a wide range of advances in medicine, biotechnology, biofuel production and even space exploration.

CReATiNG works by cloning and reassembling natural DNA segments from yeast, allowing scientists to create synthetic chromosomes that can replace their native counterparts in cells. The innovative technique enables researchers to combine chromosomes between different yeast strains and species, change chromosome structures, and delete multiple genes simultaneously.
Lead researcher Ian Ehrenreich, professor of biological sciences at USC Dornsife, said the method is a major improvement over current technology. ""With CReATiNG, we can genetically reprogram organisms in complex ways previously deemed impossible, even with new tools like CRISPR,"" he said. ""This opens up a world of possibilities in synthetic biology, enhancing our fundamental understanding of life and paving the way for groundbreaking applications.""
The study was published Dec. 20 in Nature Communications.
CReATiNG makes difficult research easier, cheaper
The field of synthetic biology has emerged as a way for scientists to take control of living cells, such as yeast and bacteria, to better understand how they work and to enable them to produce useful compounds, such as new medicines.
""Over the last decade or so, a new form of synthetic biology has emerged called synthetic genomics, which involves synthesizing whole chromosomes or entire genomes of organisms,"" Ehrenreich said. ""The thing about most synthetic genomics research is that it involves building chromosomes or genomes from scratch using chemically synthesized DNA pieces. This is a ton of work and extremely expensive.""
However, there have been no alternatives -- until now. ""CReATiNG offers an opportunity to use natural pieces of DNA as parts to assemble whole chromosomes,"" said Agilent postdoctoral fellow Alessandro Coradini, who was study first author.

The method makes advanced genetic research more accessible by significantly lowering costs and technical barriers so scientists can unlock new solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in science and medicine today.
CReATiNG could help medicine, space exploration and more
The findings are particularly significant for their potential applications in biotechnology and medicine. CReATiNG could lead to more efficient production of pharmaceuticals and biofuels, aid in the development of cell therapies for diseases like cancer and pave the way to methods of environmental bioremediation, such as creating bacteria that consume pollutants.
The method might even extend to helping humans live for long periods in space or other harsh environments. Scientists could one day use CReATiNG to develop microorganisms or plants that could thrive in space stations or during long-distance space travel, though the researchers caution that this would require much future research.
One of the most striking aspects of the study, according to the researchers, is how rearranging chromosome segments in yeast can alter their growth rates, with some modifications resulting in up to a 68% faster or slower growth. This discovery highlights the profound impact that genetic structure can have on biological function and opens up new research pathways to further explore these relationships.

In addition to Ehrenreich and Coradini, authors on the study include Christopher Ne Ville, Zachary Krieger, Joshua Roemer, Cara Hull, Shawn Yang and Daniel Lusk, all of USC Dornsife.

We use CReATiNG to synthetically recombine chromosomes between strains and species, to modify chromosome structure, and to delete many linked, non-adjacent regions totaling 39% of a chromosome. The multiplex deletion experiment reveals that CReATiNG also enables recovery from flaws in synthetic chromosome design via recombination between a synthetic chromosome and its native counterpart.

They'd been in the collections of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) since the 1870s when they were first discovered. Nestled in among the largest collection of trilobites, the unique fossils rested in drawers until 145 years later when Sarah Losso, PhD candidate in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB) at Harvard, began combing through the collection of trilobites as part of her dissertation.

""I started my PhD going through all of these thin sections of trilobites, imaging them, and trying to figure what we can actually see,"" Losso said. ""And then I came across something we never see in trilobite fossils.""
In a new study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, lead author Losso describes the unusual three-dimensional trilobite fossils prepared as thin sections showing the 3D soft tissues during enrollment. The study reveals the soft undersides of enrolled trilobites and the evolutionary mechanism that allows arthropods to enroll their bodies for protection from predators and adverse environmental conditions.
Trilobites are early arthropods from the Paleozoic Era. They were numerous and super diverse until they were wiped out in the End Permian mass extinction. Trilobites are named for their three-lobed body, which is covered by a durable exoskeleton enriched in calcite that is easily preserved; making trilobites an iconic part of the Paleozoic fossil record. Their segmented bodies have numerous limb pairs that include a walking leg and a gill for respiration. Unlike their durable exoskeleton, their undersides, including the legs, are much softer so are rarely fossilized unless the perfect conditions are met. Trilobites have no close relatives, despite their resemblance to horseshoe crabs. However, horseshoe crabs can serve as a useful comparison because of their similar lifestyle.
The challenges associated with fossilizing soft tissues make the trilobites Losso studied even more special. The fossils are from the Mohawkian Stage of the Ordovician Period (462-451 million years ago). They were discovered in the Walcott-Rust Quarry located in upstate New York near Trenton Falls; a region originally inhabited by the Iroquois tribe. The quarry is named in part after the scientist Charles D. Walcott, who discovered the enrolled trilobites there in his youth, before going on to famously discover the Burgess Shale while Director of the Smithsonian Institution.
The fossils, which Walcott sold to the MCZ and the Smithsonian in the 1870s, were trapped in a sediment slurry that quickly moved downslope and entombed the trilobites, leading to the preservation of delicate tissues before decay destroyed them. They are unusual in that the soft tissues, such as legs and antennae, are preserved in 3D. Walcott studied the fossils by cutting them into sections of paper-thin slices of rock and attaching them to glass slides using balsam sap. Though doing the best with what was available at the time, Walcott's method of preparation makes the fossils difficult to study, because 3D structures are being seen as a 2D plane.
""These were the first known complete trilobite appendages,"" said Losso, ""before their discovery in the late 1800s, scientists knew of the walking leg, but not what the gill branches looked like."" Because of the environmental disturbance, the trilobites enrolled to protect their more delicate appendages. Sediment then surrounded the legs of the partially enrolled trilobites, creating a mold of the external shape even while the tissues decayed.

Enrollment occurs in many different organisms. It is a defense strategy for animals with hard exoskeletons and softer tissues on their underside. We see enrollment in modern animals including pill bugs (isopods), pill millipedes (millipedes), and even armadillos. By enrolling their bodies, these animals can protect their vulnerable soft tissues with their hard exoskeletons from predators. In modern terrestrial arthropods, it can also protect against desiccation and loss of moisture.
While the mechanics of trilobite enrollment are well studied, these observations have only been made by examining their exoskeletons due to a lack of enrolled fossils with soft tissue preservation. Of the 20,000 species of trilobites, fewer than 40 have soft tissue preservation. And of those 40, most only preserve parts of a leg or antenna. Only a dozen species have known complete appendages, yet most of those are preserved as highly compressed, flat fossils, as is seen in the Burgess Shale from British Columbia.
""These fossils give us the first clear view of the three-dimensional organization of trilobite soft tissues, as well as the first molds of trilobites in different stages of enrollment, which allowed us to actually see how they moved their appendages and other structures in order to enroll,"" Losso said.
Trilobites and other arthropods have rows of dorsal exoskeletal plates on their back and undersides. The plates on the back, called tergites, are reinforced and much larger than the plates on the undersides. The sternites are a row of rigid plates along the underside and are softer and more prone to decay, so are rarely seen in the fossil record. The Walcott-Rust fossils, however, had preserved ventral structures including the sternites and limbs.
Though on the softer side, the sternites are too long and rigid for the animal to enroll if they cannot flex or articulate. To get around this, the sternites actually slide past each other in a dipping motion, similar to window blinds, which allows their body to scrunch up into a ball. Trilobite legs have also adapted to allow for this movement by evolving into a wedge shape that can fit together like pizza slices inside the enrolled ball.
""Because the part of the leg that attaches to the body is rarely seen, and certainly not in 3D, people frequently represented it as oval or squarish in cross-section,"" Losso said, ""but oval or square legs would not allow for the flexibility needed for full enrollment.""
Losso compared the Walcott-Rust fossils to CT scans of modern arthropods of millipedes, isopods, and horseshoe crabs, which were also housed in the MCZ collections. Losso found that modern arthropods used the same movement of sternites as we see in trilobites to enroll their bodies. Trilobites have been found throughout the Paleozoic Era. The adaptation to enroll allowed them to thrive, and they evolved structures to aid in enrollment such as the correct proportions and number of segments in the ventral to keep the body enrolled and wedge-shaped legs.
""The fossils have been known for a long time, but no one had put it together that we could study the ventral adaptations for enrollment using these really great fossils,"" Losso said. ""These fossils allowed us to compare trilobites with modern arthropods and see that there is really only one way to accomplish enrollment given the arthropod body plan. It's a great example of convergent evolution amongst all these different lineages, and across a huge swath of time because we're seeing this in the Ordovician and today. It's an important strategy for survival that thrives today.""
""Sarah's work has greatly improved our understanding of a key behavioral strategy that made trilobites incredibly successful for over 200 million years, and also brings new attention to the historical collections of Walcott-Rust fossils at the MCZ that went unstudied over 100 years,"" said senior author Javier Ortega-Hernández, Assistant Professor in OEB and Curator of Invertebrate Paleontology at the MCZ. ""The new data on the three-dimensional morphology of trilobites during enrollment will allow us to accurately model this complex strategy for the first time, and represent a beautiful example of convergent evolution in action across distantly related species.""

Enrolment is a staple habit of trilobites, and their biomineralized dorsal exoskeleton offered a versatile substrate for the evolution of interlocking devices. However, it is unknown whether trilobites also featured ventral adaptations for enrolment. Here, we report ventral exoskeletal adaptations that facilitate enrolment in exceptionally preserved trilobites from the Middle Ordovician Walcott–Rust Quarry in New York State, USA. Walcott–Rust trilobites reveal the intricate three-dimensional organization of the non-biomineralized ventral anatomy preserved as calcite casts, including the spatial relationship between the articulated sternites (i.e. ventral exoskeletal plates) and the wedge-shaped protopodites. Enrolment in trilobites is achieved by ventrally dipping the anterior margin of the sternites during trunk flexure, facilitated by the presence of flexible membranes, and with the close coupling of the wedge-shaped protopodites. Comparisons with the ventral morphology of extant glomerid millipedes and terrestrial isopods reveal similar mechanisms used for enrolment. The wedge-shaped protopodites of trilobites closely resemble the gnathobasic coxa/protopodite of extant horseshoe crabs. We propose that the trilobites' wedge-shaped protopodite simultaneously facilitated tight enrolment and gnathobasic feeding with the trunk appendages."

A new study from Lawson Health Research Institute and Western University published in the journal Microbiome has found changes in the microbiome in multiple locations in the body are linked to the formation of kidney stones.

The human microbiome comprises trillions of microorganisms, including healthy bacteria. In recent years, research has begun to uncover its role in health and numerous diseases.
The research team examined the gut, urinary and salivary microbiomes in 83 patients who had kidney stones and compared them to 30 healthy controls. They found changes in all three microbiomes were linked to kidney stone formation.
""Kidney stone disease has been rising in recent years, affecting roughly 10 per cent of people,"" says Dr. Jeremy Burton, Lawson Scientist and Research Chair of Human Microbiome and Probiotics at St. Joseph's Health Care London (St. Joseph's). ""While previous research has shown a connection between the gut microbiome and kidney stones in those who have taken antibiotics, we also wanted to explore the connection to other microbiomes in the hopes we can advance understanding and potential treatments.""
Study participants included people who had formed kidney stones, had not had antibiotic exposure in the last 90 days and were having the stones removed surgically at St. Joseph's.
""Our testing -- called shotgun metagenomic sequencing -- allowed us to discover which bacteria were present in the gut and the genetic capabilities of those bacteria, or how it functions. We also did a simpler sequencing of the oral and urinary samples,"" explains Dr. Kait Al, lead author on the study and Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Western's Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry.
Kidney stones are most commonly formed from calcium oxalate, which is a waste product produced by the body. Historically, it was thought people with specific gut microbes, like one bacterium called Oxalobacter formigenes that breaks down oxalate, were less likely to form kidney stones. This study suggests there are other factors.

""It's a more complex story. The microbes form a kind of network that's stable and beneficial in healthy people, but in those with kidney stones, that network is broken down. They're not producing the same vitamins and useful metabolites, not just in the gut but also in the urinary tract and oral cavity,"" Dr. Al explains.
There was also evidence that those with kidney stones had been exposed to more antimicrobials, as they had more antibiotic-resistant genes.
""We found not only that those who got kidney stones had an unhealthy microbiome, including a gut microbiome that was more likely to excrete toxins to the kidneys, but also that they were antibiotic resistant,"" explains Dr. Burton, also an Associate Professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Schulich Medicine & Dentistry.
The research team says that although more research is needed, these initial findings shed light on the overall importance of a person's microbiome and keeping it as healthy as possible, with a microbiome-friendly diet and minimal antibiotic use potentially part of the solution.
The study was funded in part through the Weston Foundation and supported by the American Urological Association.

By systematically comparing the gut, urinary, and oral microbiota of 83 stone formers (SF) and 30 healthy controls (HC), we provide a unified assessment of the bacterial contribution to KSD. Amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing approaches were consistent in identifying multi-site microbiota disturbances in SF relative to HC. Biomarker taxa, reduced taxonomic and functional diversity, functional replacement of core bioenergetic pathways with virulence-associated gene markers, and community network collapse defined SF, but differences between cohorts did not extend to oxalate metabolism. We conclude that multi-site microbiota alteration is a hallmark of SF, and KSD treatment should consider microbial functional restoration and the avoidance of aberrant modulators such as poor diet and antibiotics where applicable to prevent stone recurrence."

Researchers at Uppsala University, together with colleagues at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, the University of Gothenburg, and institutions in seven other countries, have studied the relationships between five closely related species of larks that occur in Africa south of the Sahara. Two of these have not been observed for decades, so the researchers analysed DNA from museum specimens, some of which were over 100 years old.

The DNA analyses revealed nine distinct evolutionary lines, which were estimated to have been separated for up to at least five million years -- which is about as long as humans and chimpanzees have been separated. Five of these branches on the tree of life are normally classified as different subspecies of Rufous-naped Lark Corypha africana and two of them as subspecies of Red-winged Lark Corypha hypermetra. Based on the genetic results, combined with extensive analyses of plumage, size/structure, vocalisations and behaviours, the researchers demonstrated that the relationships are considerably more complex and that the branches were previously missorted. They propose that the two species be split into seven. Conversely, the analyses showed that Ash's Lark Corypha ashi, which is only known from a few specimens collected in Somalia, is the same species as the slightly better-known Somali Lark Corypha somalica.
Most of the 'new' species are extremely poorly known, and the paper describes songs and behaviours for the first time for several of them. After the article was accepted for publication, the lead author, Per Alström at Uppsala University, had the opportunity to study one of the least known 'new' species in north-western Zambia, on the border with Angola, in November 2023.
""This species, which we propose be called Plains Lark Corypha kabalii, but which does not yet have a Swedish name, is even more distinct than we concluded based on the data we analysed earlier,"" Alström comments. ""Among other things, it has a unique display behaviour, which is probably used both for defending a territory and attracting females. The Plains Lark male rapidly ascends to a height of a few metres, where it claps its wings to produce a rather strong sound before descending to the ground again on spread wings.""
Another recently published paper by largely the same research group presented the family tree for all but one of the more than 100 lark species of the world. That study confirmed that many species that are similar in appearance are not closely related at all, but likely developed similarities due to similar living conditions -- so-called convergent evolution. Conversely, some close relatives have diverged so much in appearance that their close relationship can no longer be traced in their external characteristics.

Insect decline is being driven by losses among the locally more common species, according to a new study published in Nature. Led by researchers at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) and the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU), the meta-analysis of 923 locations around the world notes two significant trends: 1) the species with the most individuals (the highest abundance) are disproportionately decreasing in number, and 2) no other species have increased to the high numbers previously seen. This likely explains the frequent observation that there are fewer insects around now than ten, twenty, or thirty years ago.

Researchers at iDiv looked at long-term trends of land-based insects, such as beetles, moths, and grasshoppers, and found that decreases in the number of the formerly most common species have contributed most to local insect declines. Common or abundant insect species are those species that are locally found in the highest numbers, but which species these are differ among locations. The study's findings challenge the idea that changes in insect biodiversity result from rarer species disappearing.
The study follows the recent sounding of alarm bells about insect loss, as researchers note dramatic declines in the total number of insects in many parts of the world. However, little is known about the general trends among locally rare and abundant species over long periods. ""It was obvious this needed exploring,"" says Roel van Klink, lead author of the study and senior scientist at iDiv and MLU. ""We had to know whether observations about declines in total abundances of insects differed among common and rare species, and how this translated into changes in the overall insect diversity.""
More common species are losing out
Van Klink and colleagues set out to better understand trends in insect numbers by diving into past studies. They compiled a database on insect communities using data collected over periods between 9 and 64 years from 106 studies. For example, one Dutch study on ground beetles was started in 1959 and continues today.
With this updated database, the researchers confirmed that despite variation among the data, on the whole, land-based insects from these long-term surveys are declining by 1.5% each year. To better understand this pattern, they compared the trends of species in different abundance categories and found that species that were the most abundant at the start of the time series showed the strongest average decline -- around 8% annually -- while rarer species declined less.
Importantly, the losses of previously dominant species were not compensated for by rises in other species, which has far-reaching implications: Abundant species are a staple food for birds and other insect-eating animals, making them essential for ecosystems. ""Food webs must already be rewiring substantially in response to the decline of the most common species,"" explains van Klink. ""These species are super important for all kinds of other organisms and for the overall functioning of the ecosystem.""
Winners and Losers

The analysis clearly shows that the formerly abundant species are consistently losing the most individuals compared to the less abundant insect species. However, less abundant and rare species are also taking losses, driving declines in local species numbers. The study found a modest decrease in the overall number of species of just under 0.3% annually. This decline indicates that in addition to significant losses of common species, some rare species are going locally extinct.
Coming out on top are new arrivals who managed to successfully establish themselves. Most of these new arrivals stay locally rare and replace other formerly rare insects, but occasionally they become very abundant. The invasive Asian Ladybeetle (Harmonia axyridis), which is now common throughout Europe, the Americas and South Africa, is one such example.
According to the paper's authors, further research is necessary to determine the underlying causes of these trends. Although this study did not explicitly investigate possible causes, the declines are likely linked to recent human-related impacts, such as climate change and urbanisation, which are considered major drivers of biodiversity loss. ""Insects seem to be taking a heavier hit than many other species as humans continue to dominate the planet,"" explains Professor Jonathan Chase, senior author of the study and professor at iDiv and MLU. ""Other studies, including those our team has worked on, have not found such diversity declines at local scales from many other groups of animals and plants.""
While the study's results are striking, these trends are strongly biased to data on insect communities in Europe and North America. As such, they should not be interpreted as a global phenomenon. Chase adds: ""The patterns we observed might be a best-case scenario for quantifying the real impact of people on insects,"" referring to what scientists have called the lifeboat effect. ""These declines were observed in long-term data from areas that have remained largely intact, sort of like a lifeboat, rather than in areas where massive conversion of natural areas into human-dominated landscapes has occurred, such as malls and parking lots.""

Here we examined long-term trends in 923 terrestrial insect assemblages monitored in 106 studies, and found concomitant declines in abundance and species richness. For studies that were resolved to species level (551 sites in 57 studies), we observed a decline in the number of initially abundant species through time, but not in the number of very rare species. At the population level, we found that species that were most abundant at the start of the time series showed the strongest average declines (corrected for regression-to-the-mean effects). Rarer species were, on average, also declining, but these were offset by increases of other species. Our results suggest that the observed decreases in total insect abundance2 can mostly be explained by widespread declines of formerly abundant species. This counters the common narrative that biodiversity loss is mostly characterized by declines of rare species8,9. Although our results suggest that fundamental changes are occurring in insect assemblages, it is important to recognize that they represent only trends from those locations for which sufficient long-term data are available. Nevertheless, given the importance of abundant species in ecosystems10, their general declines are likely to have broad repercussions for food webs and ecosystem functioning."

The mammalian nose is a work of evolutionary art. Its millions of nerve cells, each tailored with just one of thousands of specific odor-chemical receptors encoded in the genome, can collectively distinguish a trillion distinct scents. Those sensations, in turn, inform many behaviors, from assessing food options to discerning friends from foes to sparking memories.

Today, in the journal Nature, a research team led by scientists at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute describes a previously undetected mechanism in mice -- starring the genetic molecule RNA -- that could explain how each sensory cell, or neuron, in mammalian noses becomes tailored to detect a specific odor chemical.
For example, there are sensory neurons in our noses that bear receptors uniquely tuned to detect ethyl vanillin, the main odorant in vanilla, and other cells with receptors for limonene, lemon's signature odorant.
""How sensory cells in the nose make their receptor choices has been one of the most vexing mysteries about olfaction,"" said Stavros Lomvardas, PhD, a Roy and Diana Vagelos Professor and Chair of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and Herbert and Florence Irving Professor of Neuroscience at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute and the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, and corresponding author on the paper. ""Now, the story behind our sense of smell, or olfaction, is becoming clearer, and also more dramatic.""
The sense-refining drama he is referring to unfolds entirely within the minuscule confines of each olfactory neuron's nucleus, where the cell's chromosomes and genes reside. There, in a Squid Games-style, winner-takes-all competition, a developing cell's myriad olfactory receptor genes vie with each other in a process that winnow them down, in stages, first to handful of finalists and then to a single winner. The prevailing gene is the one that determines the cell's odorant sensitivity. In their study, Dr. Lomvardas and his team uncover details of the final stage of this process when the winner emerges from the finalist genes.
""It's basically a battle between a 1000 contenders,"" said Ariel Pourmorady, the paper's first author and an M.D.-Ph.D. candidate at the Zuckerman Institute in the Lomvardas lab.
The action is exceedingly complex and involves a dizzying cast of molecular characters. Playing roles that either dial up or down each gene's ability to produce olfactory receptors are a variety of gene-regulating molecules. By gathering into various alliances within the genome, these molecular players help turn specific genes on or off.

Also in the fray is another set of molecular hubs that reshape portions of the genome in ways that favor specific receptor genes. When his team first observed these in the genome in 2014, Dr. Lomvardas dubbed them ""Greek Islands"" because they reminded him of islands in the Aegean Sea.
""It turns out that the genome has a certain spatial organization in the nucleus and changes in this structure are pivotal when it comes to which genes are expressed into proteins, like olfactory receptors,"" said Pourmorady. ""We are learning just how important this process is within maturing olfactory cells.""
In their new Nature paper, the researchers summon a trove of data from mouse studies pointing toward RNA as the linchpin molecule in the olfactory system's gene-choosing mechanism. RNA is most known as the go-between molecule that translates the genetic code embodied in DNA into protein molecules with specific cellular jobs, like detecting odorants. Using sophisticated techniques for analyzing changes in genome structure as cells mature, however, the researchers say their evidence points to a pivotal second role for the RNA.
""It looks like the RNA the cell makes during gene expression also is altering the genome's architecture in ways that bolster the expression of one olfactory receptor gene while also shutting down all the others,"" Pourmorady said.
Big gaps in this genome-controlling story remain, but the researchers say the outline
is becoming more defined. It starts with maturing olfactory cells, which initially express many receptor genes at those genomic hubs where gene-regulating molecules and complexes, including Greek Islands, converge.
Then the RNA winnows the contending olfactory-receptor genes down to one. The particular hub in each cell where the molecular stars align to produce the highest amount of RNA wins the competition. At this hub, receptor-gene expression soars. But, like a slinky saboteur, RNA from that same hub may wind its way to all the other hubs. In those locations, the RNA causes shape changes in the genome that shut down gene expression. The result is a nose's worth of mature olfactory neurons, each of which bears on its surface only one odorant receptor.
""We are reaching the edge of science fiction when it comes to the molecular and genomic details we now can observe inside a single cell's nucleus,"" said Dr. Lomvardas. ""We need to keep going back in to figure out the rest of this olfaction puzzle.""

OR gene choice is mediated by a multichromosomal enhancer hub that activates transcription at a single OR3,4, followed by OR-translation-dependent feedback that stabilizes this choice5,6. Here, using single-cell genomics, we show formation of many competing hubs with variable enhancer composition, only one of which retains euchromatic features and transcriptional competence. Furthermore, we provide evidence that OR transcription recruits enhancers and reinforces enhancer hub activity locally, whereas OR RNA inhibits transcription of competing ORs over distance, promoting transition to transcriptional singularity. Whereas OR transcription is sufficient to break the symmetry between equipotent enhancer hubs, OR translation stabilizes transcription at the prevailing hub, indicating that there may be sequential non-coding and coding mechanisms that are implemented by OR alleles for transcriptional prevalence. We propose that coding OR mRNAs possess non-coding functions that influence nuclear architecture, enhance their own transcription and inhibit transcription from their competitors, with generalizable implications for probabilistic cell fate decisions."

The intricate process of duplicating genetic information, referred to as DNA replication, lies at the heart of the transmission of life from one cell to another and from one organism to the next. This happens by not just simply copying the genetic information; a well-orchestrated sequence of molecular events has to happen at the right time. Scientists around Prof. Maria-Elena Torres-Padilla from Helmholtz Munich have recently uncovered a fascinating aspect of this process known as ""replication timing"" (RT) and how special this is when life commences. The new results are now published in Nature. 

The process of DNA replication timing (RT) refers to the specific moments when different regions of our genetic code are duplicated. Researchers from the Institute for Epigenetics and Stem Cells at Helmholtz Munich have implemented a technique called ""Repli-seq"" to delve into the intimate relationship between RT and the adaptability of cells, the cellular plasticity. Intriguingly, they also uncovered a new relationship between RT and how the genes fold into three-dimensional structures inside the cell nucleus.
Starting with the earliest stage of an embryo, the zygote -- the very beginning of an organism's life -- researchers have created a map of RT from this single-cell stage to the stage at which the embryo implants in the mother's womb, called a blastocyst. The unexpected discovery is that the RT in the single-celled embryo is not very ordered, leading to the suggestion that genome duplications are very flexible in these early cells. However, after the 4-cell stage, the RT becomes more defined. There is a gradual process happening, mirroring the gradual acquisition of modifications to the DNA and associated proteins, the so-called chromatin marks, that indicate the genes' activity and importance in the cell's functions.
Maria-Elena Torres-Padilla, corresponding author of the study, explains further: ""This is remarkable, as this tells us that these early embryo cells have a very 'plastic' genome duplication program. Because these early cells are totipotent, that means, they can create every single cell in our bodies. We think that what we discovered in this study is one of the reasons why these cells are so remarkably capable of generating all the body."" The new findings about DNA replication can serve as a tool to reprogram cells. Dr. Tsunetoshi Nakatani, the first author of the study, adds: ""We can envision changing the cell identity by changing its RT program into a more flexible one.""
The results further show, that RNA polymerase, commonly known as the enzyme responsible for reading the genetic code and transcribing it into RNA, contributes to determining the exact RT program, providing some cues as to how to be able to manipulate such program in the future. The research team has discovered that the three-dimensional structure of the genome takes shape first, and the RT program is established consequently. This is an exciting finding, as it posits that how our genome accommodates into the three-dimensional space of the cell nucleus influences the flexibility of the RT program.
In conclusion, DNA replication timing is a fascinating piece of the puzzle in the grand narrative of life. It demonstrates how the precision of genetic replication is intimately tied to the capacity of the cells from the early embryo to generate other cell types in our body. As researchers continue to explore these connections, we gain a deeper understanding of the very essence of life's transmission, cell to cell, organism to organism, and of what makes a cell capable of generating a new body.

Replication occurs with a defined temporal order known as the replication timing (RT) programme, leading to organization of the genome into early- or late-replicating regions. RT is cell-type specific, is tightly linked to the three-dimensional nuclear organization of the genome1,2 and is considered an epigenetic fingerprint3. In spite of its importance in maintaining the epigenome4, the developmental regulation of RT in mammals in vivo has not been explored. Here, using single-cell Repli-seq5, we generated genome-wide RT maps of mouse embryos from the zygote to the blastocyst stage. Our data show that RT is initially not well defined but becomes defined progressively from the 4-cell stage, coinciding with strengthening of the A and B compartments. We show that transcription contributes to the precision of the RT programme and that the difference in RT between the A and B compartments depends on RNA polymerase II at zygotic genome activation. Our data indicate that the establishment of nuclear organization precedes the acquisition of defined RT features and primes the partitioning of the genome into early- and late-replicating domains. Our work sheds light on the establishment of the epigenome at the beginning of mammalian development and reveals the organizing principles of genome organization."

The maintenance of a balanced lipid homeostasis is critical for our health. While consumption of excessive amounts of fatty foods contributes to metabolic diseases such as obesity and atherosclerosis, fat is an indispensable component of our diet. Digested lipids supply the body with essential building blocks and facilitate the absorption of important vitamins. In a new study published in the journal Nature, a team of researchers led by Professor Manolis Pasparakis and their collaborators Professor Aleksandra Trifunovic and Professor Christian Frezza at the Excellence Cluster CECAD of the University of Cologne, and Professor Jörg Heeren at the University of Hamburg, report on a new mechanism that regulates the processing and transport of dietary lipids by the intestine.

The researchers studied the function of mitochondria -- organelles acting as powerhouses of the cell -- in enterocytes, cells that line the intestine and specialize in the absorption and transport of nutrients from digested food. They found that disruption of mitochondrial function in the intestines of mice caused abnormal accumulation of dietary fat in enterocytes and impaired delivery of lipids to the peripheral organs.
A key finding of the study was that, when mitochondria did not function properly, enterocytes showed impaired packaging and transport of lipids in the form of chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are crucial carriers of dietary fats, and their proper formation and transport are essential for the absorption of nutrients.
""This discovery marks a significant leap forward in understanding the crucial role of mitochondria in dietary lipid transport and metabolism,"" said Dr Chrysanthi Moschandrea, the lead author of the study. The implications of this discovery go beyond the realm of basic research. ""These findings provide new perspectives for the better understanding of the gastrointestinal symptoms in patients suffering from mitochondrial disease, and may also lead to new therapeutic approaches,"" added Professor Aleksandra Trifunovic.

A key finding of the study was that, when mitochondria did not function properly, enterocytes showed impaired packaging and transport of lipids in the form of chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are crucial carriers of dietary fats, and their proper formation and transport are essential for the absorption of nutrients.
""This discovery marks a significant leap forward in understanding the crucial role of mitochondria in dietary lipid transport and metabolism,"" said Dr Chrysanthi Moschandrea, the lead author of the study. The implications of this discovery go beyond the realm of basic research. ""These findings provide new perspectives for the better understanding of the gastrointestinal symptoms in patients suffering from mitochondrial disease, and may also lead to new therapeutic approaches,"" added Professor Aleksandra Trifunovic.

The role of mitochondria in dietary lipid processing is unclear. Here we show that mitochondrial dysfunction in enterocytes inhibits chylomicron production and the transport of dietary lipids to peripheral organs. Mice with specific ablation of the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase DARS2 (ref. 2), the respiratory chain subunit SDHA3 or the assembly factor COX10 (ref. 4) in intestinal epithelial cells showed accumulation of large lipid droplets (LDs) in enterocytes of the proximal small intestine and failed to thrive. Feeding a fat-free diet suppressed the build-up of LDs in DARS2-deficient enterocytes, which shows that the accumulating lipids derive mostly from digested fat. Furthermore, metabolic tracing studies revealed an impaired transport of dietary lipids to peripheral organs in mice lacking DARS2 in intestinal epithelial cells. DARS2 deficiency caused a distinct lack of mature chylomicrons concomitant with a progressive dispersal of the Golgi apparatus in proximal enterocytes. This finding suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction results in impaired trafficking of chylomicrons from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, which in turn leads to storage of dietary lipids in large cytoplasmic LDs. Taken together, these results reveal a role for mitochondria in dietary lipid transport in enterocytes, which might be relevant for understanding the intestinal defects observed in patients with mitochondrial disorders5."

We often look to the smallest lifeforms for help solving the biggest problems: Microbes help make foods and beverages, cure diseases, treat waste and even clean up pollution. Yeast and bacteria can also convert plant sugars into biofuels and chemicals traditionally derived from fossil fuels -- a key component of most plans to slow climate change.

Now University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers have engineered bacteria that can produce two chemical products at the same time from underutilized plant fiber. And unlike humans, these multitasking microbes can do both things equally well.
""To my knowledge, it's one of the first times you can make two valuable products simultaneously in one microbe,"" says Tim Donohue, UW-Madison professor of bacteriology and director of the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center.
The discovery, detailed in a paper in the December issue of the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, could help make biofuels more sustainable and commercially viable.
""In principle, the strategy lowers the net greenhouse gas emissions and improves the economics,"" Donohue says. ""The amount of energy and greenhouse gas that you need to make two products in one pot is going to be less than running two pots to make one product in each pot.""
Every molecule counts
The quest to replace fossil fuels with sustainable alternatives hinges on extracting the most possible value from renewable biomass. Just as with petrochemicals, every molecule counts: Low-volume, high-value products help keep fuel more affordable.

One of the biggest barriers is a part of the plant cell wall called lignin. Lignin is the world's most abundant source of renewable aromatic carbons, but its irregular structure makes it notoriously difficult to break apart into useful components.
That's why scientists with GLBRC have studied a bacterium named Novosphingobium aromaticivorans (sometimes referred to as simply Novo), which can digest many components of lignin and is relatively easy to genetically modify.
In 2019, researchers engineered a strain of Novo that can produce a key ingredient of plastics like nylon and polyurethane known as PDC. More recently, a team in Donohue's lab discovered another modification that allows Novo to make a different plastic ingredient called ccMA.
But they didn't stop there.
""We're not going to solve our carbon emissions problem by only producing two products,"" says Ben Hall, a recent doctoral graduate who contributed to the research.
Donohue's team used genomic modeling to come up with a list of potential products that could be made from biomass aromatics. Near the top of the list was zeaxanthin, one of a group of organic pigments known as carotenoids.

Carotenoids, which give carrots, pumpkins, salmon and even flamingos their distinctive hues, are used as nutritional supplements, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and have a cumulative market value worth tens of billions of dollars a year.
Researchers knew that Novo had the genes to produce another carotenoid with little market value. Based on the bacteria's genome sequence, they suspected zeaxanthin is a steppingstone to that less valuable carotenoid in the process that cells use to make complex molecules. It was just a matter of altering the right genes to stop the digestive assembly line at the more valuable product.
By deleting or adding selected genes, they engineered strains that produced zeaxanthin as well as other valuable carotenoids -- beta-carotene, lycopene and astaxanthin -- when grown on an aromatic compound commonly found in lignin.
Next, the team showed that the engineered bacteria could produce the same carotenoids from a liquor made from ground and treated sorghum stems, a solution that contains a mixture of aromatics that many industrial bacteria can't digest.
One pot, two products
Hall then wondered what would happen if he combined the genetic changes needed to make PDC and a carotenoid in the same microbe.
The resulting strains produced both PDC and the target carotenoid -- with no discernable loss to either yield. Even better, the bacteria accumulated carotenoids within their cells, which must be separated from the solution that contains the PDC, which they secreted.
""We're already separating the cells from the media,"" Hall says. ""Now we would have a product coming out of both.""
The next steps include testing whether engineered strains can simultaneously produce carotenoids and ccMA, which Donohue thinks they will, and to engineer strains to improve yields in industrial conditions.
While there are lucrative markets for each of these products, Donohue and Hall say the real value of the discovery is the ability to add multiple functions to this biological platform.
""To me, it's both the strategy and the products,"" Donohue says. ""Now that we've done this, I think it opens the door to see if we can create other microbial chassis that make two products.""

Individual carotenoids are also commodity chemicals, produced industrially for use as food additives, nutritional supplements, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. The alphaproteobacterium Novosphingobium aromaticivorans has previously been established as a potential platform microbe for converting aromatic compounds derived from lignocellulosic plant biomass into valuable extracellular products. Here, we show that N. aromaticivorans DSM 12444 cells naturally produce the carotenoid nostoxanthin, and we construct a set of gene deletion mutants that accumulate β-carotene, lycopene, or zeaxanthin, which are predicted intermediates in nostoxanthin biosynthesis as well as commodity chemicals. We also show that a mutant strain heterologously expressing a CrtW protein accumulates the carotenoid astaxanthin. When grown on vanillate as the carbon source, we find that the levels of carotenoids are not significantly affected by O 2 concentration in the tested range of 5% to 21% O 2 . We also show that these carotenoids are produced at comparable levels when strains are grown in liquor from alkaline pretreated sorghum biomass [sorghum alkaline pretreatment liquor (APL)], which contains a mixture of aromatics. Finally, we construct strains that produce zeaxanthin, β-carotene, or astaxanthin concurrently with 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid, a potential building block for biodegradable polymers, when grown in sorghum APL. Combined, our results show that N. aromaticivorans can simultaneously produce valuable intracellular and extracellular commodities when grown in the presence of either pure aromatics or pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. There is economic and environmental interest in generating commodity chemicals from renewable resources, such as lignocellulosic biomass, that can substitute for chemicals derived from fossil fuels. The bacterium Novosphingobium aromaticivorans is a promising microbial platform for producing commodity chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass because it can produce these from compounds in pretreated lignocellulosic biomass, which many industrial microbial catalysts cannot metabolize. Here, we show that N. aromaticivorans can be engineered to produce several valuable carotenoids. We also show that engineered N. aromaticivorans strains can produce these lipophilic chemicals concurrently with the extracellular commodity chemical 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid when grown in a complex liquor obtained from alkaline pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. Concurrent microbial production of valuable intra- and extracellular products can increase the economic value generated from the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass-derived compounds into commodity chemicals and facilitate the separation of water- and membrane-soluble products."

Scientists at the CNRS and the University of Montpellier1 have discovered that flowering plants growing in farmland are increasingly doing without insect pollinators. As reproduction becomes more difficult for them in an environment depleted in pollinating insects, the plants are evolving towards self-fertilisation. These findings are published in a paper in the journal New Phytologist dated December 20, 2023.

By comparing field pansies growing in the Paris region today with pansies from the same localities resurrected in the laboratory from seeds collected2 between 1992 and 2001, the research team found that today's flowers are 10% smaller, produce 20% less nectar, and are less visited by pollinators than their ancestors.
This rapid evolution is thought to be due to the decline in pollinator populations in Europe. Indeed, a study conducted in Germany showed that over 75% of the biomass of flying insects has vanished from protected areas in the last thirty years.
The study identified a vicious circle in which the decline in pollinators leads to reduced nectar production by flowers, which could in turn exacerbate the decline of these insects. It underlines the importance of implementing measures to counter this phenomenon as quickly as possible and thus safeguard the interactions between plants and pollinators, which have existed for millions of years.

In general, frogs' teeth aren't anything to write home about -- they look like pointy little pinpricks lining the upper jaw. But one group of stream-dwelling frogs in Southeast Asia has a strange adaptation: two bony ""fangs"" jutting out of their lower jawbone. They use these fangs to battle with each other over territory and mates, and sometimes even to hunt tough-shelled prey like giant centipedes and crabs. In a new study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers have described a new species of fanged frog: the smallest one ever discovered.

""This new species is tiny compared to other fanged frogs on the island where it was found, about the size of a quarter,"" says Jeff Frederick, a postdoctoral researcher at the Field Museum in Chicago and the study's lead author, who conducted the research as a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. ""Many frogs in this genus are giant, weighing up to two pounds. At the large end, this new species weighs about the same as a dime.""
In collaboration with the Bogor Zoology Museum, a team from the McGuire Lab at Berkeley found the frogs on Sulawesi, a rugged, mountainous island that makes up part of Indonesia. ""It's a giant island with a vast network of mountains, volcanoes, lowland rainforest, and cloud forests up in the mountains. The presence of all these different habitats mean that the magnitude of biodiversity across many plants and animals we find there is unreal -- rivaling places like the Amazon,"" says Frederick.
While trekking through the jungle, members of the joint US-Indonesia amphibian and reptile research team noticed something unexpected on the leaves of tree saplings and moss-covered boulders: nests of frog eggs.
Frogs are amphibians, and they lay eggs that are encapsulated by jelly, rather than a hard, protective shell. To keep their eggs from drying out, most amphibians lay their eggs in water. To the research team's surprise, they kept spotting the terrestrial egg masses on leaves and mossy boulders several feet above the ground. Shortly after, they began to see the small, brown frogs themselves.
""Normally when we're looking for frogs, we're scanning the margins of stream banks or wading through streams to spot them directly in the water,"" Frederick says. ""After repeatedly monitoring the nests though, the team started to find attending frogs sitting on leaves hugging their little nests."" This close contact with their eggs allows the frog parents to coat the eggs with compounds that keep them moist and free from bacterial and fungal contamination.
Closer examination of the amphibian parents revealed not only that they were tiny members of the fanged frog family, complete with barely-visible fangs, but that the frogs caring for the clutches of eggs were all male. ""Male egg guarding behavior isn't totally unknown across all frogs, but it's rather uncommon,"" says Frederick.
Frederick and his colleagues hypothesize that the frogs' unusual reproductive behaviors might also relate to their smaller-than-usual fangs. Some of the frogs' relatives have bigger fangs, which help them ward off competition for spots along the river to lay their eggs in the water. Since these frogs evolved a way to lay their eggs away from the water, they may have lost the need for such big imposing fangs. (The scientific name for the new species is Limnonectes phyllofolia; phyllofolia means ""leaf-nester."")
""It's fascinating that on every subsequent expedition to Sulawesi, we're still discovering new and diverse reproductive modes,"" says Frederick. ""Our findings also underscore the importance of conserving these very special tropical habitats. Most of the animals that live in places like Sulawesi are quite unique, and habitat destruction is an ever-looming conservation issue for preserving the hyper-diversity of species we find there. Learning about animals like these frogs that are found nowhere else on Earth helps make the case for protecting these valuable ecosystems.""

Though male nest attendance and terrestrial egg deposition is known in one other Sulawesi fanged frog (Limnonectes arathooni), the new species exhibits a derived reproductive mode unique to the Sulawesi assemblage; male frogs guard one or more clutches of eggs festooned to leaves or mossy boulders one to two meters above small slow-moving streams, trickles, or seeps. This island endemic has thus far been collected at three sites on Sulawesi: one in the Central Core of the island, and two on the Southwest Peninsula—south of the Tempe Depression (a major biogeographical boundary). The new Limnonectes has the smallest adult body size among its Sulawesi congeners—with a maximum snout-vent length of about 30 millimeters. Beyond its unique reproductive behavior and body size, the species is further diagnosed on the basis of advertisement call and genetic distance from sympatric fanged frogs. The discovery and description of the new species highlights the remarkable reproductive trait diversity that characterizes the Sulawesi fanged frog assemblage despite that most species in this radiation have yet to be formally described."

Aquaporin (Aqp) 10 water channels in humans allow the free passage of water, glycerol, urea, and boric acid across cells. However, Aqp10.2b in pufferfishes allows only the passage of water and glycerol and not urea and boric acid. Researchers from the Tokyo Institute of Technology sought to understand the evolutionary timeline that resulted in the variable substrate selection mechanisms among Aqp10s. Their results indicate that Aqp10.2 in ray-finned fishes may have reduced or lost urea and boric acid permeabilities through evolution.

Aquaporins (Aqps) are proteins that form water channels in the membranes of living cells, including those of bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. These channels facilitate water transportation across cells more rapidly than diffusion through the membrane phospholipid bilayer.
Aqp10 belongs to the aquaglyceroporin subfamily of water channels. These proteins facilitate many of our body's physiological processes, including gut function, liver and fat cell metabolism, and skin elasticity. Water and solutes, such as glycerol, urea, and boric acid, get transported through human Aqp10 depending on concentration gradients across the membrane.
Sarcopterygians, which include coelacanths, lungfish, and tetrapods (such as amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals), are known to have a single gene that codes for Aqp10. In contrast, actinopterygians, such as ray-finned fishes, have paralogs, or near-identical copies, of the aqp10 gene, such as aqp10.1 and aqp10.2. Interestingly, the ray-finned Japanese pufferfish has paralog called aqp10.2b that shows permeability to water and glycerol but not to urea and boric acid.
To understand how these functional differences between solute permeabilities in Aqp10 in humans and pufferfish may have evolved, a team of researchers from the School of Life Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Department of Advanced Bioscience, Faculty of Agriculture, Kindai University, Department of Integrative Biology at Michigan State University, Aquamarine Fukushima AMF, and Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science analyzed Aqp10s in different species. The study was published in Genome Biology and Evolution on December 01, 2023.
When asked about their study, Dr. Ayumi Nagashima, who is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Life Science and Technology at Tokyo Tech and the lead scientist of the study, explains, ""Evolutionary adaptations in solute selectivity could present a promising model for analyzing solute permeability evolution in aquaglyceroporins. In this study, to elucidate the evolutionary history of Aqp10 solute selectivity, we analyzed and compared the permeability and evolutionary relationships of Aqp10s in eight bony vertebrate species.""
The research team found that similar to the tetrapod and lobe-finned fish Aqp10s, Aqp10.1 in ray-finned fishes also transport water, glycerol, urea, and boric acid. On the other hand, while Aqp10.2 in ray-finned fishes transport water and glycerol, they restrict urea and boric acid passage much more than Aqp10 and Aqp10.1.
These intriguing results indicate that water, glycerol, urea, and boric acid permeabilities are plesiomorphic features of Aqp10 water channels in all tetrapods and lobe-finned fish. However, the Aqp10.2 found in ray-finned fish may have reduced or lost urea and boric acid permeability during evolution.
In this regard, Dr. Nagashima remarks, ""Our study showed that the Aqp10.2 of ray-finned fishes allows only limited or no urea or boric acid transport across it. These activities were likely systematically reduced and subsequently lost through evolution in the common ancestor of these fishes. This research is expected to shed light on the elucidation of the substrate selection mechanism of aquaglyceroporins, which contributes to nutrient transport and other processes in the future.""
In summary, this study highlights that water, glycerol, urea, and boric acid transport activities are plesiomorphic activities of Aqp10 characteristic of the ancestral type common to the studied species. Consequently, the results suggest that Aqp10.2 in actinopterygians evolved to diminish the transport activity of urea and boric acid.

Tetrapods have a single aqp10 gene, whereas ray-finned fishes have paralogs of this gene through tandem duplication, whole-genome duplication, and subsequent deletion. A previous study on Aqps in the Japanese pufferfish Takifugu rubripes showed that one pufferfish paralog, Aqp10.2b, was permeable to water and glycerol, but not to urea and boric acid. To understand the functional differences of Aqp10s between humans and pufferfish from an evolutionary perspective, we analyzed Aqp10s from an amphibian (Xenopus laevis) and a lobe-finned fish (Protopterus annectens) and Aqp10.1 and Aqp10.2 from several ray-finned fishes (Polypterus senegalus, Lepisosteus oculatus, Danio rerio, and Clupea pallasii). The expression of tetrapod and lobe-finned fish Aqp10s and Aqp10.1-derived Aqps in ray-finned fishes in Xenopus oocytes increased the membrane permeabilities to water, glycerol, urea, and boric acid. In contrast, Aqp10.2-derived Aqps in ray-finned fishes increased water and glycerol permeabilities, whereas those of urea and boric acid were much weaker than those of Aqp10.1-derived Aqps. These results indicate that water, glycerol, urea, and boric acid permeabilities are plesiomorphic activities of Aqp10s and that the ray-finned fish-specific Aqp10.2 paralogs have secondarily reduced or lost urea and boric acid permeability."

Nearly every organism on Earth follows a natural circadian rhythm that is coded by your cell's clock genes, which do exactly as you suspect from the name: regulate your body's rhythm on a 24-hour basis. Most cells in mammalian bodies have cilia of some sort, which are hair-like structures that perform a variety of functions such as movement for motile cilia and aiding in structure in function for non-motile, or primary, cilia. The primary cilia also act as a sensory organ for the cell, a function which has illuminated the primary cilia's potential role in the healing process and how bodies heal at a different rate according to our circadian rhythm. In this research, the role of the primary cilia, biological clock and wound healing is explored.

Researchers published their results in EMBO Reports in November 2023.
The main findings concluded that clock proteins, which are proteins that regulate a 24-hour rhythm within a cell and are coded by clock genes, have much to do with the regulation of the primary cilia. The primary cilia act in accordance with the oscillations of the clock gene's expression and can shorten or lengthen throughout the day. The length of the primary cilia can vary and is tied to the healing process of a wound. The shorter the length of the cilia, the shorter the wound-healing time appears to be. The research done in this study observes cells from mice over 72 hours and the rise and fall of the length of the cilia is observed to be in line with the rhythm of a 24-hour cyclical period.
""This suggests that the 24-hour cycle of primary cilia on fibroblasts may underlie in part the difference of wound healing speed between daytime and nighttime,"" said Ryota Nakazato, researcher and author of the study. Fibroblasts are cells that contribute to forming connective tissue and are a major part of the healing process. The circadian rhythm in the primary cilia of these fibroblasts is more involved in wound healing during the day than at night.
The reason for this daytime-induced enhanced healing process appears to be from the relationship the 24-hour cycle has on the length of the primary cilium. During the day, the cilia are shorter and are more easily able to convert to a cell type that can invade the wound to begin the healing process. Primary cilia are possibly also involved in receiving and sending signals to the rest of the body which can also enhance wound repair. The cells with shorter primary cilia are more easily released from their ""anchor"" to start cellular migration to the wound site at an earlier time and might also more readily send out signals to increase the rate of wound repair than when the cilia length is longer.
""We expect that further analysis will clarify the role of primary cilia not only in wound healing, but also in various life phenomena that exhibit circadian rhythms, such as sleep/wakefulness, hormone secretion, and changes in body temperature,"" Nakazato said.
Although there has been some headway made with the connection of these two seemingly unrelated subjects, there's more work to be done to elucidate the mechanism by which circadian rhythm affects the body's physiology, especially in immature or embryonic cells.
These observations allow researchers to further explore the role the biological clock and its disturbances have in various health issues or disorders and can lead to the development of a field of study known as ""circadian medicine."" The findings from more in-depth research on the physiology of circadian rhythm can aid those who struggle with jet lag, insomnia and other disorders or diseases that may stem from issues in regulating the body's natural clock.

Cellular clocks provide circadian rhythms for cellular functions via transcriptional and cytoskeletal regulation. The vast majority of mammalian cells possess a primary cilium, an organelle protruding from the cell surface. Here, we investigated the little‐known relationship between circadian rhythm and primary cilia. The length and number of primary cilia showed circadian dynamics both in vitro and in vivo. The circadian rhythm of primary cilium length was abolished by SR9011 and Bmal1 knockout. A centrosomal protein, pericentrin, transiently accumulates in centriolar satellites, the base of primary cilia at the shortest cilia phase, and induces elongation of primary cilia at the longest cilia phase in the circadian rhythm of primary cilia. In addition, rhythmic cell migration during wound healing depends on the length of primary cilia and affects the rate of wound healing. Our findings demonstrate that the circadian dynamics of primary cilium length by clock genes control fibroblast migration and could provide new insights into chronobiology."

A study appearing in Nature Communications based on field and greenhouse experiments at the University of Kansas shows how a boost in agricultural yield comes from planting diverse crops rather than just one plant species: Soil pathogens harmful to plants have a harder time thriving.

""It's commonly observed that diverse plant communities can be more productive and stable over time,"" said corresponding author James Bever, senior scientist with the Kansas Biological Survey & Center for Ecological Research and Foundation Distinguished Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at KU. ""Range lands with numerous species can show increased productivity. But the reason for this has been a bit of a mystery.""
While crop rotation and other farming and gardening practices long have reflected benefits of a mix of plants, the new research puts hard data to one important mechanism underpinning the observation: the numbers of microorganisms in the soil that eat plants.
""Diverse agricultural communities have the potential to keep pathogens at bay, resulting in greater yields,"" Bever said. ""What we show is that a major driver is the specialization of pathogens, particularly those specific to different plant species. These pathogens suppress yields in low-diversity communities. A significant advantage of rangeland diversity is that less biomass is consumed by pathogens, allowing more biomass for other uses, such as cattle. The same process is crucial for agricultural production.""
The new data was developed at the University of Kansas using field experiments at the KU Field Station, along with greenhouse assays and feedback modeling using computers. This project was supported by large collaborative grants to KU from the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
""We conducted an experiment manipulating the number of plants in a plot and varying precipitation levels -- we had from one up to six species in a plot,"" Bever said. ""Then, we evaluated the composition of the soil-pathogen microbiome. What we found is that the variation in pathogen composition in monocultures significantly predicted the yield when combined. When there are distinct pathogen communities, mixing them leads to a greater release of pathogens from your neighbors. The worst scenario is when a neighboring crop has the same pathogens. In that case, you're experiencing double density -- your crop pathogens and those from your neighbor crop.""
At KU, Bever's collaborators included associate specialist Peggy Schultz as well as Haley Burrill and Laura Podzikowski, both of whom earned doctorates at KU and now are postdoctoral researchers at the University of Oregon and KU, respectively. Lead author Guangzhou Wang worked at KU as a postdoctoral researcher and now is affiliated with China Agricultural University in Beijing, where he worked on the investigation there with co-authors Fusuo Zhang and Junling Zhang. They were joined by co-author Maarten Eppinga of the University of Zurich, Switzerland.

According to Bever, the research argues against the industrial-agricultural practice of planting a single food crop over many acres of land, often referred to as ""monoculture.""
""Regarding monoculture practices, the philosophy of promoting plant diversity seems to counter prevailing practices,"" he said. ""Monoculture -- planting vast areas with a single crop -- is driven by technological reasons rather than biological ones. Practical aspects of planting and harvesting have motivated this approach. Traditional Native American agriculture and practices in the tropics involve polycultures with multiple species. In China, there's a movement towards mechanized polyculture production, challenging the predominant monoculture model in the United States. It's essential to view monoculture as a cost-benefit model with increased inputs and explore alternative methods like crop rotation to manage pathogens over time.""
Bever said mixing plants in various plots would be beneficial to home gardeners and others who cultivate plants.
""When you're gardening, you're not relying on mechanical planting and mechanical harvesting,"" he said. ""It's definitely to your advantage to mix your crops -- to plant them in heterogeneous mixes in the plot. For convenience, we might plant alternating rows of different crops. That's going to do a better job of controlling pathogens than if you just had many rows of the same crop next to each other.

You'll reduce pathogens by doing that. It's what our data shows.""
Finally, Bever said his team's findings that show biodiversity prohibits pathogen growth isn't as clear-cut outside the plant kingdom. In fact, the idea is contentious in animal systems like Lyme disease.
""Our clear result in the plant world contrasts with the complexity of this literature in the animal world,"" he said. ""In the context of recent attention on pathogens, such as with COVID, the study of pathogens in ecology has been controversial. The impact of diversity on pathogen impacts, whether it increases or decreases, has been debated. Our findings for plants indicate the bigger concern is the reduction of pathogen spread with increased diversity, rather than an increase. In our study, pathogens, including soil-dwelling ones, were examined. Similar patterns were observed with foliar pathogens, as detailed in an upcoming paper. The controversy arises from differences between how pathogens affect the animal kingdom versus plants.""

However, the generality of pathogen dilution has been controversial and rarely tested within biodiversity manipulations. Here, we test whether soil pathogen dilution generates diversity- productivity relationships using a field biodiversity-manipulation experiment, greenhouse assays, and feedback modeling. We find that the accumulation of specialist pathogens in monocultures decreases host plant yields and that pathogen dilution predicts plant productivity gains derived from diversity. Pathogen specialization predicts the strength of the negative feedback between plant species in greenhouse assays. These feedbacks significantly predict the overyielding measured in the field the following year. This relationship strengthens when accounting for the expected dilution of pathogens in mixtures. Using a feedback model, we corroborate that pathogen dilution drives overyielding. Combined empirical and theoretical evidence indicate that specialist pathogen dilution generates overyielding and suggests that the risk of losing productivity benefits from diversity may be highest where environmental change decouples plant-microbe interactions."

Almost all eukaryotic organisms, from plants and animals to fungi, can't survive without mitochondria -- the ""powerhouses of the cell,"" which generate chemical energy using oxygen. However, a new study by Lukáš Novák and Vladimír Hampl of Charles University, published in the journal PLOS Genetics, finds that multiple members of the oxymonads, a group of single-celled protists that live inside the guts of termites and other animals, have evolved to live quite happily without them.

Many groups of protists have evolved simplified mitochondria, but for a long time, scientists thought it was impossible for a species to completely lose them. The first eukaryotic organism discovered to live without mitochondria was an oxymonad isolated from the intestines of a chinchilla. In the new study, the research team looked to see if similar organisms had also shed them. They compared genomic data from the original oxymonad to multiple related species to see if they could decipher how the organisms evolved to live without this supposedly vital part of the cell.
The researchers showed that multiple oxymonads have gotten rid of their mitochondria -- possibly the entire lineage. This event likely would have occurred at least 100 million years ago, before the ancestor of the oxymonads diversified into multiple species. The findings also demonstrate that it's possible for eukaryotic organisms to thrive without mitochondria, and to evolve into the wide range of shapes and specialized structures seen in oxymonads living today.
The authors add: ""These microbes have been thriving without mitochondria since the age of dinosaurs.""

The latter two taxa harbour conspicuous mitochondrion-related organelles (MROs). Here we report high-quality genome and transcriptome assemblies of two Preaxostyla representatives, the free-living Paratrimastix pyriformis and the oxymonad Blattamonas nauphoetae. We performed thorough comparisons among all available genomic and transcriptomic data of Preaxostyla to further decipher the evolutionary changes towards amitochondriality, endobiosis, and unstacked Golgi. Our results provide insights into the metabolic and endomembrane evolution, but most strikingly the data confirm the complete loss of mitochondria for all three oxymonad species investigated (M. exilis, B. nauphoetae, and Streblomastix strix), suggesting the amitochondriate status is common to a large part if not the whole group of Oxymonadida. This observation moves this unique loss to 100 MYA when oxymonad lineage diversified."

Are we able to differentiate between the vocal emissions of certain primates? A team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) asked volunteers to categorise the vocalisations of three species of great apes (Hominidae) and humans. During each exposure to these ''onomatopoeia'', brain activity was measured. Unlike previous studies, the scientists reveal that phylogenetic proximity -- or kinship -- is not the only factor influencing our ability to identify these sounds. Acoustic proximity -- the type of frequencies emitted -- is also a determining factor. These results show how the human brain has evolved to process the vocal emissions of some of our closest cousins more efficiently. Find out more in the journal Cerebral Cortex Communications.

Our ability to process verbal language is not based solely on semantics, i.e. the meaning and combination of linguistic units. Other parameters come into play, such as prosody, which includes pauses, accentuation and intonation. Affective bursts -- ''Aaaah!'' or ''Oh!'' for example -- are also part of this, and we share these with our primate cousins. They contribute to the meaning and understanding of our vocal communications.
When such a vocal message is emitted, these sounds are processed by the frontal and orbitofrontal regions of our brain. The function of these two areas is, among other things, to integrate sensory and contextual information leading to a decision. Are they activated in the same way when we are exposed to the emotional vocalisations of our close cousins the chimpanzees, macaques and bonobos? Are we able to differentiate between them?
MRI scans with headphones on
A UNIGE team sought to find out by exposing a group of 25 volunteers to various human and simian vocalisations. ''The participants were placed in an MRI scanner and were given headphones. After a short period of familiarisation with the different types of vocalisations, each participant had to categorise them, i.e. identify to which species they belonged,'' explains Leonardo Ceravolo, senior lecturer at the UNIGE's Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, and first author of the study.
These vocalisations were of the affiliative type, i.e. linked to a positive interaction, or of the agonistic type, i.e. linked to a threat or distress. The human vocalisations came from databases recorded by actors. The simian ones came from field recordings made as part of previous research. This study is the first of its kind to include bonobo vocalisations.
Bonobos, not so close cousins
The results show that for macaque and chimpanzee vocalisations, the frontal and orbitofrontal regions of the participants were activated in a similar way to human vocalisations. The participants were able to differentiate between them easily. On the other hand, when confronted with the ''sounds'' of bonobos, also close cousins of humans, the involved cerebral areas were much less activated, and categorisation was at chance level.
''It was thought that kinship between species -- the 'phylogenetic distance' -- was the main parameter for having the ability, or not, to recognise these different vocalisations. We thought that the closer we were genetically, the more important this ability was,'' explains Didier Grandjean, full professor at the Swiss Center for Affective Sciences and at the UNIGE's Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, who led the study. ''Our results show that a second parameter comes into play: acoustic distance. The further the dynamics of the acoustic parameters, such as the frequencies used, are from those of humans, the less certain frontal regions are activated. We then lose the ability to recognise these sounds, even if they are emitted by a close cousin, in this case the bonobo.""
Bonobo calls are very high-pitched and can sound like those of certain birds. This acoustic distance in terms of frequencies, compared with human vocalisations, explains our inability to decode them, despite our close phylogenetic proximity. ''Are we capable of identifying the different emotional aspects of affiliative or agonistic vocalisations emitted by a chimpanzee, a macaque or a bonobo? And if so, how? Thiese questions will be at the heart of our next research, which will involve analysing not our ability to categorise vocalisations by species but to identify their emotional content,'' concludes Didier Grandjean.

Classification was above chance level for all species but bonobo vocalizations. Imaging analyses were computed using a participant-specific, trial-by-trial fitted probability categorization value in a model-based style of data analysis.

Wild North American grapes are now less of a mystery after an international team of researchers led by the University of California, Davis, decoded and catalogued the genetic diversity of nine species of this valuable wine crop.

The research, published in the journal Genome Biology, uncovers critical traits that could accelerate grape breeding efforts, particularly in tackling challenges like climate change, saline environments and drought.
""This research marks a significant step in understanding the genetics of grapevines,"" said Dario Cantù, the senior author on the journal article and a professor in the Department of Viticulture and Enology. ""It lays the groundwork for future advancements in grape breeding by identifying key genes responsible for important traits.""
The research team developed and used state-of-the-art technology to construct a comprehensive pangenome, which is a complete genetic blueprint, of wild grape species.
This so-called super-pangenome of nine species allowed the team to map genetic diversity, identify similarities or differences among them, and pinpoint specific traits that breeders may want to incorporate. First author Noé Cochetel, a postdoctoral researcher in Cantù's lab, did the analyses and played a pivotal role in the project.
It is the first North American wild grape pangenome to be mapped and catalogued, Cantù said.
""This offers tremendous potential for advancing sustainable grape cultivation, especially in regions facing water scarcity challenges,"" said Cantù, a plant biologist who also holds the Louis P. Martini Endowed chair. ""This pangenome will enable further genetic exploration of other vital adaptive traits, essential for industry resilience, like drought tolerance, heat resistance and defense against Pierce's disease.""
Caused by a strain of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, Pierce's disease kills grapevines by clogging their water-conducting vessels.

Wild grape pros and cons
North American grapes are known for their resistance to disease and adaptability, but they are not favored for taste and wine quality. European grapevines like chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon are less resistant to diseases but are renowned for producing high-quality wines.
North American species have a wide geographic range. As a consequence, they have evolved to withstand diverse climatic, soil and pathogen conditions, encompassing a broad spectrum of genetic diversity.
That is why nearly all wine grapes produced worldwide are from European vines grafted onto North American rootstocks.
Ability to select traits
The detailed pangenome will empower breeders to selectively incorporate desired traits from wild grapes, such as salt tolerance, while avoiding less desirable characteristics.
""Salt tolerance is a crucial trait for rootstocks,"" Cantù noted. ""Identifying these traits at a genetic level is a major advancement for grape breeding.""

Genetic diversity across a genus can be captured in super-pangenomes, which provide a framework for interpreting genomic variations. Here we report the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of nine wild North American grape genomes, which are phased and scaffolded at chromosome scale. We generate a reference-unbiased super-pangenome using pairwise whole-genome alignment methods, revealing the extent of the genomic diversity among wild grape species from sequence to gene level. The pangenome graph captures genomic variation between haplotypes within a species and across the different species, and it accurately assesses the similarity of hybrids to their parents. The species selected to build the pangenome are a great representation of the genus, as illustrated by capturing known allelic variants in the sex-determining region and for Pierce’s disease resistance loci. Using pangenome-wide association analysis, we demonstrate the utility of the super-pangenome by effectively mapping short reads from genus-wide samples and identifying loci associated with salt tolerance in natural populations of grapes. This study highlights how a reference-unbiased super-pangenome can reveal the genetic basis of adaptive traits from wild relatives and accelerate crop breeding research."

Researchers report in the journal Geohealth that local rivers and streams were the source of the Salmonella enterica contamination along coastal North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in 2018 -- not the previously suspected high number of pig farms in the region.

These findings have critical implications for controlling the spread of disease caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens after flooding events, particularly in the coastal regions of developing countries that are being highly impacted by the increase in tropical storms.
The study, led by University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign civil and environmental engineering professor Helen Nguyen and graduate student Yuqing Mao, tracks the presence and origin of S. enterica from environmental samples from coastal North Carolina using genetic tracing.
""Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens are responsible for approximately 2.8 million human illnesses and 36,000 deaths per year in the U.S. alone,"" Nguyen said. ""These infections spread easily across the globe and are a major burden on burgeoning health care systems, but they are preventable through mitigation.""
The study reports that because human and animal fecal genetic markers are often found in flood waters, it is commonly assumed wastewater sources, septic systems and livestock farms are responsible for spreading antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genetic material into the environment. However, no known studies have conclusively identified contaminant source points.
""Coastal North Carolina is a great case study area because there is a high concentration of swine farms and private septic systems, and coastal flooding caused by tropical storms is fairly common,"" Nguyen said.
Three weeks after Hurricane Florence, Nguyen's team collected 25 water samples from water bodies downstream of the swine farms in agricultural production areas in North Carolina, 23 of which contained the S. enterica bacteria.

""We analyzed free-floating genetic markers -- chromosomes and plasmids -- using high-fidelity whole-genome sequencing and found that S. enterica in the samples collected after Hurricane Florence were not from animals or manure,"" Nguyen said.
The team genetically traced the bacteria's origin to the many small local rivers and streams in the area -- meaning that these pathogens have already established themselves in the natural environment.
""With climate change bringing warmer temperatures -- in which bacteria thrive -- and possibly larger and more frequent tropical storms, the importance of our findings needs to be realized by researchers and policymakers,"" Nguyen said. ""Agricultural and human wastewater should not be the only source considered when designing mitigation plans to prevent the spread of pathogenic bacteria after hurricanes.""
Nguyen's team plans to extend this research beyond coastal regions and is collaborating with other campus researchers to study the spread of pathogens from Canada goose feces in Illinois.
Researchers from the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, the Carle Illinois College of Medicine and the University of Florida also contributed to this study.
The IGB, The Grainger College of Engineering, the Allen Foundation and the EPA supported this study.

In this study, we use high‐resolution whole genomic sequencing to examine the origin and distribution of Salmonella enterica after the 2018 Hurricane Florence flooding. We specifically asked whether S. enterica isolated from water samples collected near swine farms in North Carolina shortly after Hurricane Florence had evidence of swine origin. To investigate this, we isolated and fully sequenced 18 independent S. enterica strains from 10 locations (five flooded and five unflooded). We found that all strains have extremely similar chromosomes with only five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and possessed two plasmids assigned bioinformatically to the incompatibility groups IncFIB and IncFII. The chromosomal core genome and the IncFIB plasmid are most closely related to environmental Salmonella strains isolated previously from the southeastern US. In contrast, the IncFII plasmid was found in environmental S. enterica strains whose genomes were more divergent, suggesting the IncFII plasmid is more promiscuous than the IncFIB type. We identified 65 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in each of our 18 S. enterica isolates. All ARGs were located on the Salmonella chromosome, similar to other previously characterized environmental isolates. All isolates with different SNPs were resistant to a panel of commonly used antibiotics. These results highlight the importance of environmental sources of antibiotic‐resistant S. enterica after extreme flood events."

Plants often develop communities with microorganisms in their roots, which influences plant health and development. Although the recruitment of these microbes is dictated by several factors, it is unclear whether the genetic variation in the host plants plays a role. In a new study, researchers from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign explored this question and their work can help improve agriculture productivity.

""Previously, researchers have only looked at what kind of microbes are present in association with plants, but not what might be driving the formation of these communities and how we might be able to control these drivers through plant breeding,"" said Angela Kent (CABBI), a professor of natural resources and environmental sciences.
Microbes form complex communities called microbiomes in and around the roots of plants. The host plants can dictate which microbes are invited into their roots -- known as endophytes -- using chemical signals. They can also alter the soil properties around the roots to influence which microbes can grow around the root surface, or rhizosphere. However, in order to breed plants based on what microbes they associate with, researchers first need to understand the extent to which plant genomes can influence the rhizosphere microbiome.
To answer this question, the researchers studied two native silver grass species -- Miscanthus sinensis and Miscanthus floridulus. These plants are considered potential bioenergy crops because they require lower nutrient concentrations to achieve more growth compared to traditional crops.
The study was conducted in 16 sites across Taiwan and included a range of environmental conditions, such as hot springs, mountain peaks, and valleys, to represent all possible environmental extremes. The researchers collected 236 rhizosphere soil samples from randomly selected Miscanthus plants and also isolated the microbiome inside the roots.
""Although the scale of this study was unprecedented, we were mindful of the plant protection and quarantine regulations. We processed the samples in Taiwan to extract the endophytic microbial community and collect the rhizosphere microbiome,"" Kent said.
The researchers used two types of DNA sequencing techniques in their study. The microbiomes in and around the roots were identified using the DNA sequence of bacterial and fungal rRNA genes, focusing on the part of the genome that is unique to each species. The variation in the plant genome was measured using microsatellites, which are small pieces of repeating DNA that can distinguish even closely related plant populations.

""The samples were collected 15 years ago, when the project was too large for the sequencing capabilities at the time. As the cost of sequencing came down, it allowed us to revisit the data and take a closer look at the microbiome. During sample processing, we also inadvertently extracted plant DNA and we were able to use that as a resource for genotyping our Miscanthus populations,"" Kent said.
""We screened the host genome sequences for insights into how they can affect the microbiome,"" said Niuniu Ji, a postdoctoral researcher in the Kent lab. ""I discovered that the plants affect the core microbiome, which was exciting.""
Although plant microbiomes are very diverse, the core microbiome is a collection of microbes that are found in most samples of a particular set of plants. These microbes are considered to play an important role in organizing which other microbes are associated with the plant and helping with host growth.
The core microbiome that the researchers found in Miscanthus included nitrogen-fixing bacteria that have been found in rice and barley in other studies. All these microbes play a role in helping the plants acquire nitrogen, which is a vital nutrient for plant growth. Recruiting nitrogen-fixing microbes may help the plants adapt to different environments, but importantly, this capability contributes to the sustainability of this grass as a potential bioenergy crop.
On the other hand, the influence of the genetic variation among the plants had a lower effect on the rhizosphere microbiome, which was more strongly affected by the soil environment. Even so, the plants placed a greater emphasis on recruiting fungi compared to other microbes.
The researchers are interested in parsing out which genes play a role in influencing the microbiome. ""The microsatellites do not have a biological function and are not representative of the whole genome. It would be nice if we could sequence the whole Miscanthus genome and figure out how the genes affect nitrogen fixation,"" Ji said.
""Crop breeding is based on yield. However, we need to take a wider look and consider how microbes can contribute to crop sustainability,"" Kent said. ""The appeal of working with wild plants is that there is vast genetic variation to look at. We can identify which variants are good at recruiting nitrogen-fixing microbes because we can use fewer fertilizers on these crops. It's an exciting possibility as we embark on adapting these plants for bioenergy purposes.""

Here we examined prokaryotic and fungal communities between rhizosphere soils and the root endophytic compartment in two native Miscanthus species (Miscanthus sinensis and Miscanthus floridulus) of Taiwan and further explored the roles of host plant on root-associated microbiomes. Our results suggest that host plant genetic variation, edaphic factors, and site had effects on the root endophytic and rhizosphere soil microbial community compositions in both Miscanthus sinensis and Miscanthus floridulus, with a greater effect of plant genetic variation observed for the root endophytic communities. Host plant genetic variation also exerted a stronger effect on core prokaryotic communities than on non-core prokaryotic communities in each microhabitat of two Miscanthus species. From rhizosphere soils to root endophytes, prokaryotic co-occurrence network stability increased, but fungal co-occurrence network stability decreased. Furthermore, we found root endophytic microbial communities in two Miscanthus species were more strongly driven by deterministic processes rather than stochastic processes. Root-enriched prokaryotic OTUs belong to Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Sphingobacteriia, and [Saprospirae] both in two Miscanthus species, while prokaryotic taxa enriched in the rhizosphere soil are widely distributed among different phyla. We provide empirical evidence that host genetic variation plays important roles in root-associated microbiome in Miscanthus. The results of this study have implications for future bioenergy crop management by providing baseline data to inform translational research to harness the plant microbiome to sustainably increase agriculture productivity."

In a phase-one human clinical trial, a University of Houston pharmacist researcher has demonstrated that a newer generation tetracycline antibiotic, called Omadacycline, may be a promising tool in combating the resilient bacteria Clostridioides difficile (C diff), which causes an infection often picked up in hospitals. C diff brings on diarrhea and colitis, an inflammation of the colon, and is responsible for nearly 500,000 infections annually in the United States.

The fight against C diff takes its toll internally, including a significant disruption of gut microbiota, usually by broad-spectrum antibiotics, leading to loss of colonization resistance to C difficile. Omadacycline demonstrated a low likelihood of causing C diff in clinical trials, but no one understood why.
Kevin Garey, Robert L. Boblitt Endowed Professor of Drug Discovery at the UH College of Pharmacy, assessed the pharmacokinetics and gut microbiome effects of oral Omadacycline in comparison to Vancomycin, another possible C diff drug. Vancomycin is used to treat C diff but is not good at eliminating it over the long-term. Garey's team investigated whether Omadacycline, given orally, achieves high concentration in the gut and the effect on the gut microbiome, the healthy bacteria that lives in the colon.
""Our research shows off the coolness of the microbiome. Omadacycline caused a distinctly different effect on the microbiome than Vancomycin. This could explain why Omadacycline is a safe drug to give to patients at high risk for C diff infection. This could become a new method in drug development to see if antibiotics are not only killing the bacteria causing infections (the bad bugs) but not causing harm to the beneficial microbes that live in our body (the good bugs),"" said Garey, whose results were published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases. ""I would hope that this becomes a normal part of the antibiotic drug development process.""
In the study, 16 healthy volunteers tolerated Omadacycline with no safety differences compared to the other antibiotic. A rapid initial increase in fecal concentration of Omadacycline was observed compared to Vancomycin, with maximum concentrations achieved within 48 hours. Rapid increase is a good thing -- it means the active drug is getting to the site of the infection faster.
""Both the Omadacycline and Vancomycin groups showed significant changes in their microbiomes when we looked at how diverse they were internally (alpha diversity). However, when we compared the changes between the two groups (beta diversity), they were noticeably different from each other,"" reported Garey.
Garey's team includes Jinhee Jo, assistant professor, University of Houston College of Pharmacy; and Blake M. Hanson and Hossaena Ayele, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health.

Humans have wiped out around 1,400 bird species -- twice as many as previously thought -- with major implications for the ongoing biodiversity crisis, a new study has found.

Many of the world's islands were previously untouched paradises, but the arrival of people to places like Hawaii, Tonga and the Azores led, over time, to far-reaching impacts including deforestation, overhunting and the introduction of invasive species. Consequently, bird species were wiped out.
While the demise of many birds since the 1500s has been recorded, our knowledge of the fate of species before this relies on fossils, and these records are limited because birds' lightweight bones disintegrate over time. This conceals the true extent of global extinctions.
Researchers now believe 1,430 bird species -- almost 12 per cent -- have died out over modern human history, since the Late Pleistocene around 130,000 years ago, with the vast majority of them becoming extinct directly or indirectly due to human activity.
The study, led by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) and published in Nature Communications, used statistical modelling to estimate the undiscovered bird extinctions.
Lead author Dr Rob Cooke, an ecological modeller at UKCEH, says: ""Our study demonstrates there has been a far higher human impact on avian diversity than previously recognised. Humans have rapidly devastated bird populations via habitat loss, overexploitation and the introduction of rats, pigs and dogs that raided nests of birds and competed with them for food. We show that many species became extinct before written records and left no trace, lost from history.""
Dr Søren Faurby of the University of Gothenburg, a co-author of the study, adds: ""These historic extinctions have major implications for the current biodiversity crisis.

""The world may not only have lost many fascinating birds but also their varied ecological roles, which are likely to have included key functions such as seed dispersal and pollination. This will have had cascading harmful effects on ecosystems so, in addition to bird extinctions, we will have lost a lot of plants and animals that depended on these species for survival.""
Observations and fossils show 640 bird species have been driven extinct since the Late Pleistocene period -- 90 per cent of these on islands inhabited by people. These range from the iconic Dodo of Mauritius to the Great Auk of the North Atlantic to the lesser-known Saint Helena Giant Hoopoe. But the researchers estimated there have been further 790 unknown extinctions, meaning a total of 1,430 lost species -- leaving just under 11,000 today.
The scientists say their study has uncovered the largest human-driven vertebrate extinction event in history, during the 14th century, estimating that 570 bird species were lost after people first arrived in the Eastern Pacific, including Hawaii and the Cook Islands -- nearly 100 times the natural extinction rate.
They believe there was also a major extinction event in the ninth century BC, primarily driven by the arrival of people to the Western Pacific, including Fiji and the Mariana Islands, as well as the Canary Islands, and highlight the ongoing extinction event, which started in the mid-18th century. Since then, in addition to an increase in deforestation and spread of invasive species, birds have faced the additional human-driven threats of climate change, intensive agriculture and pollution.
Previous research by the authors suggests we are at risk of losing up to 700 additional bird species in the next few hundred years, which would be an unprecedented human-driven decimation of species. But Dr Cooke points out: ""Whether or not further bird species will go extinct is up to us. Recent conservation has saved some species and we must now increase efforts to protect birds, with habitat restoration led by local communities.""
The study team based their modelled estimates on known extinctions and the extent of relevant research effort in regions compared to New Zealand. The country is the only place in the world where the pre-human bird fauna is believed to be completely known, with well-preserved remains of all birds there. The fewer studies in a region, the more incomplete the fossil record is expected to be, and the greater the number of estimated undiscovered extinctions.

Hence, while many human-driven bird extinctions (i.e., extinctions caused directly by human activities such as hunting, as well as indirectly through human-associated impacts such as land use change, fire, and the introduction of invasive species) have been recorded, the true number is likely much larger. Here, by combining recorded extinctions with model estimates based on the completeness of the fossil record, we suggest that at least ~1300–1500 bird species (~12% of the total) have gone extinct since the Late Pleistocene, with 55% of these extinctions undiscovered (not yet discovered or left no trace). We estimate that the Pacific accounts for 61% of total bird extinctions. Bird extinction rate varied through time with an intense episode ~1300 CE, which likely represents the largest human-driven vertebrate extinction wave ever, and a rate 80 (60–95) times the background extinction rate. Thus, humans have already driven more than one in nine bird species to extinction, with likely severe, and potentially irreversible, ecological and evolutionary consequences."

X-ray imaging visualizes hidden structures and processes in living cells and organisms. The radiation that consists of highly energy-rich electromagnetic waves, however, has an ionizing effect and may damage the genetic material. This limits the possible observation period. While conventional X-ray images of soft tissue are of low contrast, phase contrast methods produce far better image contrasts at a reduced radiation dose. With higher resolution, however, gentle imaging becomes increasingly difficult, as a higher dose is required. Moreover, the efficiency of the usually applied high-resolution detectors decreases, as a result of which radiation exposure is further increased. So far, high-resolution X-ray phase contrast imaging of living biological specimens has been possible for a few seconds to minutes only, before severe damage is caused by the radiation.

Researchers from KIT's Laboratory for Applications of Synchrotron Radiation (LAS), Institute for Photon Science and Synchrotron Radiation, and Physikalisches Institut have now developed a method that uses radiation more efficiently and produces images of micrometer resolution. The method is suited for both living specimens and sensitive materials and opens up new opportunities in biology, biomedicine, and materials sciences. The new system combines X-ray phase contrast with a so-called Bragg magnifier and a photon-counting detector.
Directly Enlarged X-ray Image
""Instead of converting the X-ray image into an image with visible light and enlarging it afterwards, we enlarge it directly,"" LAS doctoral researcher Rebecca Spiecker says. ""Thanks to this approach, we can use highly efficient large-area detectors."" The researchers use a photon-counting detector with a pixel size of 55 micrometers. Before, the X-ray image of the specimen is enlarged with a so-called Bragg magnifier, as a result of which the resolution of the specimen proper reaches about 1 micrometer. The Bragg magnifier consists of two perfect silicon crystals, whose enlarging effect results from asymmetric diffraction in the silicon crystal lattice. Another big advantage of the Bragg magnifier is the very good optical image transmission. It allows for the nearly loss-free reproduction of all spatial frequencies up to the resolution limit.
Parasitic Wasps Observed for 30 Minutes
Thanks to the combination of propagation-based X-ray phase contrast with a Bragg magnifier and a photon-counting detector, all of which are optimized for an X-ray energy of 30 kiloelectron-volts (keV), the method reaches about the maximum possible dose efficiency for X-ray phase contrast. This allows for far longer observation times of small living organisms with micrometer resolution. Together with scientists from all over Germany, the researchers demonstrated the method in a pilot study of smallest parasitic wasps. For more than 30 minutes, they observed the wasps in their host eggs and how they emerged from them. ""The method is also suited for biomedical applications, an example being the gentle three-dimensional histological investigation of biopsy samples,"" Spiecker says. The researchers now plan to further improve the setup, to enlarge the field of view, and to increase mechanical stability for even longer measurements.

Apes recognize photos of groupmates they haven't seen for more than 25 years and respond even more enthusiastically to pictures of their friends, a new study finds.

The work, which demonstrates the longest-lasting social memory ever documented outside of humans, and underscores how human culture evolved from the common ancestors we share with apes, our closest relatives, was published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
""Chimpanzees and bonobos recognize individuals even though they haven't seen them for multiple decades,"" said senior author Christopher Krupenye, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies animal cognition. ""And then there's this small but significant pattern of greater attention toward individuals with whom they had more positive relationships. It suggests that this is more than just familiarity, that they're keeping track of aspects of the quality of these social relationships.""
Adds lead author Laura Lewis, a biological anthropologist and comparative psychologist at University of California, Berkeley: ""We tend to think about great apes as quite different from ourselves but we have really seen these animals as possessing cognitive mechanisms that are very similar to our own, including memory. And I think that is what's so exciting about this study.""
The research team was inspired to pursue the question of how long apes remember their peers because of their own experiences working with apes -- the sense that the animals recognized them when they'd visit, even if they'd been away for a long while.
""You have the impression that they're responding like they recognize you and that to them you're really different from the average zoo guest,"" Krupenye said. ""They're excited to see you again. So our goal with this study was to ask, empirically, if that's the case: Do they really have a robust lasting memory for familiar social partners?""
The team worked with chimpanzees and bonobos at Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland, Planckendael Zoo in Belgium, and Kumamoto Sanctuary in Japan. The researchers collected photographs of apes that had either left the zoos or died, individuals that participants hadn't seen for at least nine months and in some cases for as long as 26 years. The researchers also collected information about the relationships each participant had with former groupmates -- if there had been positive or negative interactions between them, etc.

The team invited apes to participate in the experiment by offering them juice, and while they sipped it, the apes where shown two side-by-side photographs -- apes they'd once known and total strangers. Using a non-invasive eye-tracking device, the team measured where the apes looked and for how long, speculating they'd look longer at apes they recognized.
The apes looked significantly longer at former groupmates, no matter how long they'd been apart. And they looked longer still at their former friends, those they'd had more positive interactions with.
In the most extreme case during the experiment, bonobo Louise had not seen her sister Loretta nor nephew Erin for more than 26 years at the time of testing. She showed a strikingly robust looking bias toward both of them over eight trials.
The results suggest great ape social memory could last beyond 26 years, the majority of their 40 to 60-year average lifespan, and could be comparable to that of humans, which begins to decline after 15 years but can persist as long as 48 years after separation. Such long lasting social memory in both humans and our closest relatives suggests that this kind of memory was likely already present millions of years ago in our common evolutionary ancestors. This memory likely forged a foundation for the evolution of human culture and enabled the emergence of uniquely-human forms of interaction such as intergroup trade where relationships are maintained over many years of separation, the authors said.
The idea that apes remember information about the quality of their relationships, years beyond any potential functionality, is another novel and human-like finding of the work, Krupenye said.
""This pattern of social relationships shaping long-term memory in chimpanzees and bonobos is similar to what we see in humans, that our own social relationships also seem to shape our long-term memory of individuals,"" Lewis said.

The work also raises the questions of whether the apes are missing individuals they're no longer with, especially their friends and family.
""The idea that they do remember others and therefore they may miss these individuals is really a powerful cognitive mechanism and something that's been thought of as uniquely human,"" Lewis said. ""Our study doesn't determine they are doing this, but it raises questions about the possibility that they may have the ability to do so.""
The team hopes the findings deepen people's understanding of the great apes, all of which are endangered species, while shedding new light on how deeply they could be affected when poaching and deforestation separate them from their groupmates.
""This work clearly shows how fundamental and long lasting these relationships are. Disruption to those relationships is likely very damaging,"" Krupenye said.
The team would next like to explore whether these long-lasting social memories are special to great apes or something experienced by other primates. They would also like to test how rich the memories of apes are, if, for instance, they possess lasting memories for experiences as well as individuals.
The work was made possible by Templeton World Charity Foundation grant TWCF-20647 and CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholars program.

Although individual recognition is widespread among animals and sometimes lasts for years, little is known about social memory in nonhuman apes and the shared evolutionary foundations of human social memory. In a preferential-looking eye-tracking task, we presented chimpanzees and bonobos ( N = 26) with side-by-side images of a previous groupmate and a conspecific stranger of the same sex. Apes’ attention was biased toward former groupmates, indicating long-term memory for past social partners. The strength of biases toward former groupmates was not impacted by the duration apart, and our results suggest that recognition may persist for at least 26 y beyond separation. We also found significant but weak evidence that, like humans, apes may remember the quality or content of these past relationships: apes’ looking biases were stronger for individuals with whom they had more positive histories of social interaction. Long-lasting social memory likely provided key foundations for the evolution of human culture and sociality as they extended across time, space, and group boundaries."

In a spectacular new study, researchers from the University of Copenhagen have used light and chlorine to eradicate low-concentration methane from air. The result gets us closer to being able to remove greenhouse gases from livestock housing, biogas production plants and wastewater treatment plants to benefit the climate. The research has just been published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has determined that reducing methane gas emissions will immediately reduce the rise in global temperatures. The gas is up to 85 times more potent of a greenhouse gas than CO2, and more than half of it is emitted by human sources, with cattle and fossil fuel production accounting for the largest share.
A unique new method developed by a research team at the University of Copenhagen's Department of Chemistry and spin-out company Ambient Carbon has succeeded in removing methane from air.
""A large part of our methane emissions comes from millions of low-concentration point sources like cattle and pig barns. In practice, methane from these sources has been impossible to concentrate into higher levels or remove. But our new result proves that it is possible using the reaction chamber that we've have built,"" says Matthew Stanley Johnson, the UCPH atmospheric chemistry professor who led the study.
Earlier, Johnson presented the research results at COP 28 in Dubai via an online connection and in Washington D.C. at the National Academy of Sciences, which advises the US government on science and technology.
Reactor cleans methane from air 
Methane can be burnt off from air if its concentration exceeds 4 percent. But most human-caused emissions are below 0.1 percent and therefore unable to be burned.

To remove methane from air, the researchers built a reaction chamber that, to the uninitiated, looks like an elongated metal box with heaps of hoses and measuring instruments. Inside the box, a chain reaction of chemical compounds takes place, which ends up breaking down the methane and removing a large portion of the gas from air.
""In the scientific study, we've proven that our reaction chamber can eliminate 58 percent of methane from air. And, since submitting the study, we have improved our results in the laboratory so that the reaction chamber is now at 88 percent,"" says Matthew Stanley Johnson.
Chlorine is key to the discovery. Using chlorine and the energy from light, researchers can remove methane from air much more efficiently than the way it happens in the atmosphere, where the process typically takes 10-12 years.
""Methane decomposes at a snail's pace because the gas isn't especially happy about reacting with other things in the atmosphere. However, we've discovered that, with the help of light and chlorine, we can trigger a reaction and break down the methane roughly 100 million times faster than in nature,"" explains Johnson.
Up next: livestock stalls, wastewater treatment plants and biogas plants
A 40ft shipping container will soon arrive at the Department of Chemistry. When it does, it will become a larger prototype of the reaction chamber that the researchers built in the laboratory. It will be a ""methane cleaner"" which, in principle, will be able to be connected to the ventilation system in a livestock barn.

""Today's livestock farms are high-tech facilities where ammonia is already removed from air. As such, removing methane through existing air purification systems is an obvious solution,"" explains Professor Johnson.
The same applies to biogas and wastewater treatment plants, which are some of the largest human-made sources of methane emissions in Denmark after cattle production.
As a preliminary investigation for this study, the researchers traveled around the country measuring how much methane leaks from cattle stalls, wastewater treatment plants and biogas plants. In several places, the researchers were able to document that a large amount of methane leaks into the atmosphere from these plants.
""For example, Denmark is a pioneer when it comes to producing biogas. But if just a few percent of the methane from this process escapes, it counteracts any climate gains,"" concludes Johnson.
The research is funded by a grant from Innovation Fund Denmark for the PERMA project, a part of AgriFoodTure. The research was conducted in collaboration between the University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University, Arla, Skov and the UCPH spin-out company Ambient Carbon, started and now headed by Professor Matthew Stanley Johnson. The company was started to develop MEPS (Methane Eradication Photochemical System) technology and make it available to society.
ABOUT THE METHOD
The researchers built a reaction chmaber and devised a method that simulates and greatly accelerates methane's natural degradation process.
They dubbed the method the Methane Eradication Photochemical System (MEPS) and it degrades methane 100 million times faster than in nature.
The method works by introducing chlorine molecules into a reaction chamber with methane gas. The researchers then shine UV light onto the chlorine molecules. The light's energy causes the molecules to split and form two chlorine atoms.
The chlorine atoms then steal a hydrogen atom from the methane, which then falls apart and decomposes. The chlorine product (hydrochloric acid) is captured and subsequently recycled in the chamber.
The methane turns into carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) in the same way as the natural process does in the atmosphere.
More about methane (CH4):
Methane can be burned off to remove it from air, but its concentration must be over 4%, 40,000 parts per million (ppm) to be flammable. As most human-caused emissions are below 0.1 percent, they cannot be burned.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has determined that reducing methane gas emissions will immediately reduce the rise in global temperatures.
Methane is a greenhouse gas that is emitted naturally from, among other things, wetlands and from man-made sources such as food production, natural gas and sewage treatment plants.
Today, methane gas is responsible for a third of the greenhouse gases that affect the climate and cause global warming.
It takes methane 10-12 years to decompose naturally in the atmosphere, where it is converted into carbon dioxide.
Over a 25-year period, methane is 85 times worse for the climate than CO2. Over a 100-year period, methane is 30 times worse for the climate than CO2.
The concentration of methane in the atmosphere has increased by 150% since the mid-1700s.
Methane alone has increased anthropogenic radiation exposure by 1.19 W/m^2, which is responsible for a 0.6 ?C increase in global average surface air temperature, according to the IPCC.

A laboratory prototype of the methane eradication photochemical system (MEPS) technology achieves 58% removal efficiency with a flow capacity of 30 l min−1; a reactor volume of 90 l; UV power input at 368 nm of 110 W; chlorine concentration of 99 ppm; and a methane concentration of 55 ppm; under these conditions the apparent quantum yield (AQY) ranged from 0.48% to 0.56% and the volumetric energy consumption ranged from 36 to 244 kJ m−3. The maximum achieved AQY with this system was 0.83%. A series of steps that can be taken to further improve performance are described.

Occam's razor -- the principle that, when faced with competing explanations, we should choose the simplest that fits the facts -- is not just a tool of science. Occam's razor is science, insists a renowned molecular geneticist from the University of Surrey.

In a paper published by Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, Professor Johnjoe McFadden argues Occam's razor -- attributed to the Surrey-born, Franciscan friar, William of Occam (1285 -- 1347) -- is the only feature that differentiates science from superstition, pseudoscience or fake news.
Professor McFadden said:
""What is science? The rise of issues such as vaccine hesitancy, climate scepticism, alternative medicine, and mysticism reveals significant levels of distrust or misunderstanding of science amongst the general public. The ongoing Covid enquiry also highlights how scientific ignorance extends into the heart of government. Part of the problem is that most people, even most scientists, have no clear idea of what science is actually about.""
Factors often cited as being the essence of science, such as experimentation or mathematics, are widely used in disciplines as diverse as gardening, accounting, cooking or astrology. Alchemists performed thousands of experiments attempting to transform base metal into gold but got nowhere, whereas astrologers use mathematics to calculate horoscopes. Neither is considered science. But why?
William of Occam insisted that science is the search for the simplest solutions. Occam's razor was adopted by Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton to, for example, argue that Earth orbits the sun, not the other way around, because it is simpler. They used the razor to clear a path through mysticism, superstition, and religion to found modern science. The razor continues to be invaluable, helping to predict, for example, the Higgs boson.
Professor McFadden continued:
""Whereas practitioners of mysticism, alternative medicine, pseudoscience or fake news can invent spirits, demons conspiracies or Elvis on the moon, to make sense of their world, scientists will always adopt the simplest solution to even the most complex problems. That is the beauty of Occam's razor.""
""While mysticism, alternative medicine, and fake news often resort to elaborate explanations like spirits or moon-landing conspiracies, scientists seek the simplest solutions to complex problems. Today's world, riddled with pseudoscience and misinformation, partly stems from a poor grasp of science. Often taught as a jumble of obscure theories and complex equations, science can overwhelm students, driving them away. However, portraying science as a method to find simple explanations for our world's complexities, using experimentation, mathematics, and logic, could make it accessible to all, including politicians.""

Scientists looking to uncover the mysteries of the underwater world have more valuable information at their fingertips thanks to an international team that has produced an inventory of species confirmed or expected to produce sound underwater.

Led by Audrey Looby from the University of Florida Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, the Global Library of Underwater Biological Sounds working group collaborated with the World Register of Marine Species to document 729 aquatic mammals, other tetrapods, fishes, and invertebrates that produce active or passive sounds. In addition, the inventory includes another 21,911 species that are considered to likely produce sounds.
With more than 70% of the Earth's surface covered in water, most of the planet's habitats are aquatic, and there is a misconception that most aquatic organisms are silent. The newly published comprehensive digital database on what animals are known to make sounds is the first of its kind and can revolutionize marine and aquatic science, the researchers said.
""Eavesdropping on underwater sounds can reveal a plethora of information about the species that produce them and is useful for a variety of applications, ranging from fisheries management, invasive species detection, improved restoration outcomes, and assessing human environmental impacts,"" said Looby, who also co-created FishSounds, which offers a comprehensive, global inventory of fish sound production research.
The team's research, ""Global Inventory of Species Categorized by Known Underwater Sonifery,"" was published Monday in Scientific Data and involved 19 authors from six countries, funding from the Richard Lounsbery Foundation and centuries of scientific effort to document underwater sounds.
""Understanding how marine species interact with their environments is of global importance, and this data being freely available is a major step toward that goal,"" said Kieran Cox, a member of the research team and a National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada fellow.
Most people are familiar with whale or dolphin sounds but are often surprised to learn that many fishes and invertebrates use sounds to communicate, too, Looby said.
""Our dataset helps demonstrate how widespread underwater sound production really is across a variety of animals, but also that we still have a lot to learn,"" she said.

Some coral species can be resilient to marine heat waves by ""remembering"" how they lived through previous ones, research by Oregon State University scientists suggests.

The study, funded by the National Science Foundation, also contains evidence that the ecological memory response is likely linked to the microbial communities that dwell among the corals.
The findings, published today in Global Change Biology, are important because coral reefs, crucial to the functioning of planet Earth, are in decline from a range of human pressures including climate change, said the study's lead author, Alex Vompe.
""It is vital to understand how quickly reefs can adapt to ever more frequent, repeated disturbances such as marine heat waves,"" said Vompe, a doctoral student who works in the lab of microbiology professor Rebecca Vega Thurber. ""The microbiomes living within their coral hosts might be a key component of rapid adaptation.""
Heat waves are likely to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change, he added. Slowing down the rate of coral cover and species loss is a major conservation goal, and predicting and engineering heat tolerance are two important tools.
Knowing the role microbes play in adaptation can inform coral gardening and planting efforts, Vompe said. A deeper understanding of the microbial processes, and the organisms responsible for ecological memory, can also aid in developing probiotics and/or monitoring protocols to assess and act on the quality of ecological memory of individual coral colonies.
Coral reefs are found in less than 1% of the ocean but are home to nearly one-quarter of all known marine species. They also help regulate the sea's carbon dioxide levels and are a crucial source for scientists searching for new medicines.

Corals are made up of interconnected animal hosts called polyps that house microscopic algae inside their cells. Corals also house functionally and taxonomically diverse bacteria, viruses, archaea and microeukaryotes. The community of bacteria and archaea living within corals are referred to as the coral microbiome.
Symbiosis is the foundation of the coral reef ecosystem as these microbes benefit coral hosts by assisting in carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycling, essential vitamin supplementation, and protection against pathogens. The coral polyps in turn provide nutrition and protection to the algae and bacteria.
Climate change is threatening coral reefs in part because some of the relationships between coral and their microbes can be stressed by warming oceans to the point of dissolution -- a collapse of the host-microbe partnerships, which results in a phenomenon known as coral bleaching.
""But Acropora retusa, a prevalent coral species in the Mo'orean coral reef that we studied, appears to have a powerful ecological memory response to heat waves that the microbiome seems to play a role in,"" Vompe said. ""This means some coral species may be more resilient to climate change than previously thought.""
Vompe, Vega Thurber and colleagues at OSU, the University of California, Santa Barbara, Arizona State University, and the University of Essex spent five years studying 200 coral colonies at a reef on the north shore of Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Mo'orea is an island in the South Pacific, roughly halfway between Australia and South America.
Because of the reef's recent history, it presented a unique opportunity to examine heat wave response, the researchers said.

In 2010, crown-of-thorns starfish and a cyclone destroyed more than 99% of the corals, effectively hitting the reset button on the reef. Corals reestablished and went through comparatively minor heat wave events in 2016 and 2017 before experiencing the area's most severe marine heat wave in recorded history between December 2018 and July 2019.
The second-most severe heat wave soon followed, between February and July of 2020.
""We observed that some species of coral seem to remember exposure to past marine heat waves and maintain a higher level of health in subsequent heat waves,"" Vega Thurber said. ""And Acropora retusa's memory response was strongly linked to changes in its microbiome, supporting the idea that the microbial community has a part in this process.""
Cauliflower corals in the genus Pocillopora stayed in good health through the heat events, and their microbiomes also showed an ecological memory response, she noted. They were perturbed by the initial 2019 heat wave but recovered to their predisturbance state despite the second heat wave in 2020.
""Members of coral microbial communities have unique biological features that make them more adaptable and responsive to environmental change -- short generation cycles, large population sizes and diverse metabolic potential,"" Vega Thurber said. ""In two of the three coral species we focused on, we identified initial microbiome resilience, host and microbiome acclimatization, or developed microbiome resistance to repeated heat stress. The latter two patterns are consistent with the concept of ecological memory.""
Other Oregon State researchers involved the research were Thomas Sharpton, Hannah Epstein and Emily Schmeltzer. Sharpton is an associate professor of microbiology and statistics; Epstein was a postdoctoral researcher during the study and is now a lecturer at the University of Essex; Schmeltzer, a doctoral student in Vega Thurber's lab, has graduated and is working as a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation also supported this research.

In scleractinian corals, questions remain about the microbiome's role in resistance and resilience to factors contributing to the ongoing global coral decline and whether microbes serve as a form of holobiont ecological memory. To test if and how coral microbiomes affect host health outcomes during repeated disturbances, we conducted a large‐scale (32 exclosures, 200 colonies, and 3 coral species sampled) and long‐term (28 months, 2018–2020) manipulative experiment on the forereef of Mo'orea, French Polynesia. In 2019 and 2020, this reef experienced the two most severe marine heatwaves on record for the site. Our experiment and these events afforded us the opportunity to test microbiome dynamics and roles in the context of coral bleaching and mortality resulting from these successive and severe heatwaves. We report unique microbiome responses to repeated heatwaves in Acropora retusa, Porites lobata, and Pocillopora spp., which included: microbiome acclimatization in A. retusa, and both microbiome resilience to the first marine heatwave and microbiome resistance to the second marine heatwave in Pocillopora spp. Moreover, observed microbiome dynamics significantly correlated with coral species‐specific phenotypes. For example, bleaching and mortality in A. retusa both significantly increased with greater microbiome beta dispersion and greater Shannon Diversity, while P. lobata colonies had different microbiomes across mortality prevalence. Compositional microbiome changes, such as changes to proportions of differentially abundant putatively beneficial to putatively detrimental taxa to coral health outcomes during repeated heat stress, also correlated with host mortality, with higher proportions of detrimental taxa yielding higher mortality in A. retusa. This study reveals evidence for coral species‐specific microbial responses to repeated heatwaves and, importantly, suggests that host‐dependent microbiome dynamics may provide a form of holobiont ecological memory to repeated heat stress."

In a study comparing human brain communication networks with those of macaques and mice, EPFL researchers found that only the human brains transmitted information via multiple parallel pathways, yielding new insights into mammalian evolution.

When describing brain communication networks, EPFL senior postdoctoral researcher Alessandra Griffa likes to use travel metaphors. Brain signals are sent from a source to a target, establishing a polysynaptic pathway that intersects multiple brain regions ""like a road with many stops along the way.""
She explains that structural brain connectivity pathways have already been observed based on networks (""roads"") of neuronal fibers. But as a scientist in the Medical Image Processing Lab (MIP:Lab) in EPFL's School of Engineering, and a research coordinator at CHUV's Leenaards Memory Centre, Griffa wanted to follow patterns of information transmission to see how messages are sent and received. In a study recently published in Nature Communications, she worked with MIP:Lab head Dimitri Van de Ville and SNSF Ambizione Fellow Enrico Amico to create ""brain traffic maps"" that could be compared between humans and other mammals.
To achieve this, the researchers used open-source diffusion (DWI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from humans, macaques, and mice, which was gathered while subjects were awake and at rest. The DWI scans allowed the scientists to reconstruct the brain ""road maps,"" and the fMRI scans allowed them to see different brain regions light up along each ""road,"" which indicated that these pathways were relaying neural information.
They analyzed the multimodal MRI data using information and graph theory, and Griffa says that it is this novel combination of methods that yielded fresh insights.
""What's new in our study is the use of multimodal data in a single model combining two branches of mathematics: graph theory, which describes the polysynaptic 'roadmaps'; and information theory, which maps information transmission (or 'traffic') via the roads. The basic principle is that messages passed from a source to a target remain unchanged or are further degraded at each stop along the road, like the telephone game we played as children.""
The researchers' approach revealed that in the non-human brains, information was sent along a single ""road,"" while in humans, there were multiple parallel pathways between the same source and target. Furthermore, these parallel pathways were as unique as fingerprints, and could be used to identify individuals.

""Such parallel processing in human brains has been hypothesized, but never observed before at a whole-brain level,"" Griffa summarizes.
Potential insights for evolution and medicine
Griffa says that the beauty of the researchers' model is its simplicity, and its inspiration of new perspectives and research avenues in evolution and computational neuroscience. For example, the findings can be linked to the expansion of human brain volume over time, which has given rise to more complex connectivity patterns.
""We could hypothesize that these parallel information streams allow for multiple representations of reality, and the ability to perform abstract functions specific to humans.""
She adds that although this hypothesis is only speculative, as the Nature Communications study involved no testing of subjects' computational or cognitive ability, these are questions that she would like to explore in the future.
""We looked at how information travels, so an interesting next step would be to model more complex processes to study how information is combined and processed in the brain to create something new.""
As a memory and cognition researcher, she is especially interested in using the model developed in the study to investigate if parallel information transmission could confer resilience to brain networks, and potentially play a role in neurorehabilitation after brain injury, or in the prevention of cognitive decline in pathologies of advanced age.
""Some people age healthily, while others experience cognitive decline, so we'd like to see if there is a relationship between this difference and the presence of parallel information streams, and whether they could be trained to compensate neurodegenerative processes.""

How did communication strategies in macroscale brain networks adapt across evolution to accomplish increasingly complex functions? By applying a graph- and information-theory approach to assess information-related pathways in male mouse, macaque and human brains, we show a brain communication gap between selective information transmission in non-human mammals, where brain regions share information through single polysynaptic pathways, and parallel information transmission in humans, where regions share information through multiple parallel pathways. In humans, parallel transmission acts as a major connector between unimodal and transmodal systems. The layout of information-related pathways is unique to individuals across different mammalian species, pointing at the individual-level specificity of information routing architecture. Our work provides evidence that different communication patterns are tied to the evolution of mammalian brain networks."

A warmer environment could mean more mosquitoes as it becomes harder for their predators to control the population, according to a recent study led by Virginia Commonwealth University researchers.

As the cover feature in Ecology, a journal published by the Ecological Society of America, the study -- ""Warming and Top-Down Control of Stage-Structured Prey: Linking Theory to Patterns in Natural Systems"" -- found that rising temperatures, often linked to climate change, can make predators of mosquito larvae less effective at controlling mosquito populations. Warmer temperatures accelerate development time of larvae, leading to a smaller window of time that dragonflies could eat them.
This means there could be nearly twice as many mosquito larvae that make it to adulthood in the study area. The researchers looked at riverine rock pools at Belle Isle along the James River in Richmond and found that warmer temperature pools had more aquatic mosquito larvae, even when their predators that naturally control the populations were present.
The native rock pool mosquito is not an important disease vector, but it is one of the few local mosquitoes that doesn't have to feed as an adult to lay eggs. So the findings might apply to similar taxa, like the invasive Asian rock pool mosquito.
""We might see larger populations of everyone's least favorite bug, mosquitoes. While the mosquito larvae we studied here [are] the North American rock pool mosquito, these findings likely apply to species of mosquito that do act as vectors for diseases like West Nile or even Zika virus,"" said Andrew T. Davidson, Ph.D., lead researcher on the study. He conducted the research through the Ph.D. program in VCU's Center for Integrative Life Sciences Education.
Predators help stabilize ecosystems and food webs, and the study looked at predator-prey interaction between dragonfly nymphs and mosquito larvae. Before field work, the research was rooted in concepts of thermal physiology and short-term lab experiments that yielded predictive models of the relationship between predators, prey and temperature in the field. The field study then tested the models in a complete natural environment.
The study builds on Davidson's earlier research in Functional Ecology as well as work by lab mate C. Ryland Stunkle and the rest of the VCU rock pool team. The team also acknowledges the collaborative support of professor Brian Byrd of Western Carolina University's College of Health and Human Sciences.
The recent work led by Davidson was part of a larger National Science Foundation grant that has involved scientists from VCU, the University of Richmond, Radford University, Western Carolina University and Eastern Carolina University. The collaborative award of nearly $1 million has included nearly $400,000 for VCU.

Predictions are commonly based on short‐term experiments and models, and these studies often yield conflicting results depending on the environmental context, spatiotemporal scale, and the predator and prey species considered. Thus, the accuracy of predicted changes in interaction strength, and their importance to the broader ecosystems they take place in, remain unclear. Here, we attempted to link one such set of predictions generated using theory, modeling, and controlled experiments to patterns in the natural abundance of prey across a broad thermal gradient. To do so, we first predicted how warming would impact a stage‐structured predator–prey interaction in riverine rock pools between Pantala spp. dragonfly nymph predators and Aedes atropalpus mosquito larval prey. We then described temperature variation across a set of hundreds of riverine rock pools (n = 775) and leveraged this natural gradient to look for evidence for or against our model's predictions. Our model's predictions suggested that warming should weaken predator control of mosquito larval prey by accelerating their development and shrinking the window of time during which aquatic dragonfly nymphs could consume them. This was consistent with data collected in rock pool ecosystems, where the negative effects of dragonfly nymph predators on mosquito larval abundance were weaker in warmer pools. Our findings provide additional evidence to substantiate our model‐derived predictions while emphasizing the importance of assessing similar predictions using natural gradients of temperature whenever possible."

In a new analysis of data spanning more than three decades in the eastern United States, a team of scientists found a concerning trend -- an increasing number of wildfires across a large swath of America.

""It's a serious issue that people aren't paying enough attention to: We have a rising incidence of wildfires across several regions of the U.S., not only in the West,"" said Victoria Donovan, lead author of the study and an assistant professor of forest management at the UF/IFAS West Florida Research and Education Center. ""We're allocating the majority of resources to fire suppression in the western part of the country, but we have evidence that other areas are going to need resources, too.""
The team used data from the federal Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity Database from the years 1984 to 2020, the most recently available dataset at the time, to quantify the characteristics of large wildfires -- each burning over 200 hectares, or 490 acres. This included identifying which regions during that period had the largest fires, most land burned and seasonality factors.
Their findings indicated increasing wildfire risk across the southern and eastern portions of what's known as the Eastern Temperate Forests, an area that roughly bisects the country from Michigan in the north to the eastern half of Texas in the south.
""The eastern U.S. has the most expansive wildland-urban interface in the country and thus is at high risk from wildfire,"" Donovan said. ""The thought behind this research was that if there are signals that wildfires are increasing, we need to understand what those changes look like.""
Particularly in the Southeast, Donovan said, the data showed increasing trends in wildfire numbers, the size of the events, total hectares burned, shifts in seasonality, and overall increases in the annual probability of large wildfires.
""We didn't see the same trends in the northern part of the region we examined, but that doesn't mean there were no wildfires there,"" she said. ""This data only included large wildfires, so smaller fires may have been occurring in that time.""
Three major factors influence wildfire regimes, which is the term fire scientists use to refer to an overall pattern in which fires naturally occur in a given ecosystem.

""The first is the ignition pattern, or what starts the fires,"" Donovan said. ""The second is changes in vegetation or fuel patterns, and then you have climate characteristics. We don't address the drivers of the trends in this study, but it's hard to talk about changing conditions without considering that climate may be a factor.""
As far as ignition patterns are concerned, Donovan said human ignitions still make up the majority of wildfires; but this is unsurprising in these areas, especially, being home to the majority of the country's population. This category also accounts for human-created infrastructure, like power lines.
""It's not necessarily human ignitions driving the trend of increasing wildfire patterns,"" she said. ""In other words, we're not seeing an indication that there are proportionally more human-caused ignitions than there have been in the past. In the Southern Coastal Plain, which includes much of Florida, lightning ignitions played an important role, too, contributing more to the total area burned in the ecoregion despite being a less frequent cause of large wildfire ignition.""
Overall, Donovan says the study highlights the need for proactive management of forested land and individual preparedness for people living in the eastern United States.
""We don't have the expansive wildfire problem that the western U.S. does yet, so this is also an opportunity to get ahead of the problem and prepare for shifting wildfire patterns before we start seeing the frequent destructive fires that we're seeing in the West,"" Donovan said. ""We're hopeful that this study will spur more research into understanding changing wildfire patterns in the east, but also that it will help to support an increase in prescribed fire management and motivate people to better prepare for wildfire in their location by hardening their homes and making escape plans.""

We found increases in large wildfire size, occurrence, number, and total hectares burned in the southern and eastern regions of the Eastern Temperate Forests. In contrast, large wildfires declined or were minimal in northern ecoregions. We demonstrate increasing large wildfires across some of the most populated regions of the United States."

In a first-of-its-kind study of aardvarks, Oregon State University researchers spent months in sub-Saharan Africa collecting poop from the animal and concluded that aridification of the landscape is isolating them, which they say could have implications for their long-term survival.

""Everyone had heard of aardvarks and they are considered very ecologically important but there has been little study of them,"" said Clint Epps, a wildlife biologist at Oregon State. ""We wanted to see if we could collect enough data to begin to understand them.""
In a just-published paper in Diversity and Distribution, the researchers used genetic information gleaned from 104 aardvark poop samples to begin to understand the range of where they live.
""During times of rapid environmental change, evaluating and describing changes in the landscape where a species lives is important for informed conservation and management decisions,"" said Rachel Crowhurst, a wildlife geneticist who works with Epps and co-authored the paper.
Aardvarks are nocturnal, burrowing mammals that can weigh up to 180 pounds. They have long snouts, similar to that of a pig, that they use, along with their claws, to locate and dig out ant and termite hills. They are found over much of the southern two-thirds of Africa.
Despite often being compared to pigs and South American anteater, aardvarks are not related to them. Aardvarks are the only living member of the order Tubulidentata, and their most closely living relatives include golden moles, elephants and manatees.
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists aardvarks in the category of ""least concern,"" in part due to the broad range of ecosystems they inhabit. However, little is known about current population trends or their actual distribution across the landscape. The Oregon State researchers believe the species is understudied because they are nocturnal, hard to trap and exist in low densities across large and often remote landscapes.

Those factors led Epps to undertake the first study of the genetics of aardvarks in the wild and to develop noninvasive methods to do so. People have examined aardvark DNA in the past for studies of mammalian evolution, but never across wild populations.
Epps learned to recognize aardvark tracks and poop (which they bury) when working as post-doctoral researcher nearly 20 years ago in Tanzania. In 2016, during a sabbatical, he returned to Africa for six weeks to see if he could spot aardvark digging signs, track them through the bush and find their buried droppings.
""I wanted to work on a system that was understudied, where anything I learned would likely be truly new information to the scientific community,"" Epps said. ""I also wanted to work over large landscapes, on foot, alone or with a friend or with guards when needed, in protected areas, with minimal logistical support and little cost.""
He learned how to find their feces on that 2016 trip and returned for shorter trips in 2017 with a graduate student Rob Spaan and in 2018 with Crowhurst.
They surveyed eight protected and four privately owned areas in South Africa, two protected areas in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and a location in Kenya. They collected 253 fecal samples and analyzed 104 that were of the highest quality for genetic information.
They then used the genetic information to infer aardvark distribution and movement across the landscape. For example, if genetic testing showed that fecal samples collected in different spots came from the same aardvark, they then used this information to determine the scale of individual movements.

In South Africa, the genetic information they gathered suggested three regional divisions of aardvarks, indicating that animals in western, central and eastern regions of South Africa were somewhat isolated from each other. Individuals were detected at multiple locations separated by up to 7 kilometers, indicating that home ranges could be larger than previously determined, particularly in arid areas where food resources may be low.
Closely related individuals were detected as far as 44 km apart, and individuals less than 55 km were more genetically similar. Thus, they found aardvarks may disperse up to 55 km from where they are born. Across the study area, genetic differentiation between individuals was greater when intervening landscapes were more arid, suggesting that movement through those areas is restricted.
The researchers plan to continue the work and hope to perform genomic analysis on new samples and conduct field work across a wider area of sub-Saharan Africa.
""Our initial findings suggest that climate change will increase habitat fragmentation and limit gene flow for aardvarks, particularly where precipitation is expected to decrease and temperature increase,"" Epps said. ""With aridity expected to increase in southern-most Africa under most climate change scenarios, the need for further research is clear.""
Epps other hope for further research: to see an aardvark in the wild. That goal has eluded him.
The paper was also co-authored by Spaan and Matt Weldy of Oregon State and Hannah Tavalire of the University of Oregon.

We surveyed 8 protected and 4 privately owned areas in South Africa, 2 protected areas in Eswatini and one location in Kenya during 2016–2018. We developed microsatellite markers and methods for DNA extraction from faeces, collected and genotyped faecal samples from focal areas and estimated genetic structure. We inferred space use from individual redetections, tested for close relatives and estimated genetic neighbourhood distance. We applied individual‐based landscape genetic analyses at multiple scales to test hypotheses about genetic differentiation by landscape resistance and potential adaptive differences. We developed 19 variable microsatellite loci and collected 253 faecal samples from 13 focal areas. We genotyped 104 samples successfully at ≥8 loci as needed for individual identification. The genetic structure suggested 3 regional divisions in South Africa. We detected individuals at locations ≤7.3 km distant and closely related individuals at ≤44 km; genetic neighbourhood distance was <55 km. Lower precipitation increased landscape resistance and strongly predicted genetic differentiation at most spatial scales. Temperature differences at sampling sites also influenced structure, suggesting climate‐associated adaptive differences. The genetic structure of aardvarks is strongly shaped by climate, with arid areas limiting gene flow and reflects apparent isolation by adaptation associated with temperature. Dispersal distances likely are <55 km. The markers we developed will facilitate studies of space use, dispersal, population density or survival. Aridification will increase fragmentation and we recommend monitoring aardvark presence as an indicator of ecosystem change associated with aridification."

Understanding how viruses travel once inside the human body is critical to develop effective drugs and therapies that can stop viruses in their tracks. Scientists at Texas Biomedical Research Institute (Texas Biomed) recently published findings in the Journal of Infectious Diseases indicating that Ebola virus creates and uses intercellular tunnels to move from cell to cell and evade treatments.

""Our findings suggest that the virus can create its hiding place, hide and then move to new cells and replicate,"" says Olena Shtanko, PhD, an Assistant Professor at Texas Biomed and senior paper author.
Specifically, the virus is generating something called tunneling nanotubes -- dynamic connections between cells that allow the cells to communicate by exchanging particles over relatively long distances, up to 200 microns. While these structures have been shown to play a prominent role in promoting neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, HIV-1 and influenza, Dr. Shtanko is the first to investigate their role in disseminating Ebola virus.
""When we launched this project a couple of years ago, we thought the general model of spread of Ebola virus infection -- where a viral particle infects a cell, replication begins, new virus particles are made and released into the body to infect neighboring cells -- was a bit too simplistic,"" says Dr. Shtanko.
Using state-of-the-art technology with live scanning electron and high-resolution 3D-microscopy, Dr. Shtanko and her team showed that Ebola virus infection in cells enhanced the formation of tunneling nanotubes containing viral particles. The tunneling nanotubes then promoted the transfer of these particles to other cells. Notably, the full virus was not required to trigger nanotube formation, only small sections of the virus coding for individual proteins were needed.
This happened even in the presence of treatments meant to stop Ebola virus.
""Importantly, we observed that Ebola virus infection could spread in cultures treated with virus entry inhibitors or therapeutic treatments that stop viruses from entering a cell,"" Dr. Shtanko explains.
How exactly Ebola virus particles are transported through tunneling nanotubes is still an open question. Dr. Shtanko and her team plan to try to find answers using advanced technologies such laser microdissection, mass spectrometry and low-abundance RNA sequencing. They will also explore if related viruses, including deadly Sudan and Marburg viruses, exploit the same mechanism to spread infection. In collaboration with Texas Biomed Professor Ricardo Carrion, Jr., PhD, the team will analyze tissues from animal models for virus-containing nanotubes.
This research was funded by two R21 grants #AI151717 and #AI154336 from the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases and two Texas Biomedical Forum grants.

EBOV enters the cell by macropinocytosis and replicates in the cytoplasm, and nascent virions egress from the cell surface to infect neighboring cells. Here, we show that EBOV uses an alternate route to disseminate: tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). TNTs, an actin-based long-range intercellular communication system, allows for direct exchange of cytosolic constituents between cells. Using live, scanning electron, and high-resolution quantitative 3-dimensional microscopy, we show that EBOV infection of primary human cells results in the enhanced formation of TNTs containing viral nucleocapsids. TNTs promote the intercellular transfer of nucleocapsids in the absence of live virus, and virus could replicate in cells devoid of entry factors after initial stall. Our studies suggest an alternate model of EBOV dissemination within the host, laying the groundwork for further investigations into the pathogenesis of filoviruses and, importantly, stimulating new areas of antiviral design."

As climate change redistributes terrestrial ecosystems across the globe, the world's natural capital is expected to decrease, causing a 9% loss of ecosystem services by 2100. That's according to a study of natural capital published today in the journal Nature led by scientists at the University of California, Davis, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego.

Breathable air, clean water, healthy forests and biodiversity all contribute to people's well-being in ways that can be very difficult to quantify. ""Natural capital"" is the concept scientists, economists and policymakers use to represent the current and future flow of benefits the world's natural resources bring to people.
""The big question is what do we lose when we lose an ecosystem?"" said lead author Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, a doctoral student at UC Davis when the study was conducted and currently a postdoctoral fellow at Scripps. ""Flipping the question: What do we gain if we are able to limit climate change and avoid some of its impacts on natural systems? This study helps us better consider damages not usually accounted for. It also reveals an overlooked, yet startling dimension of climate change effects on natural systems -- its capacity to exacerbate global economic inequality.""
Profound inequalities
When countries lose natural capital, their economies suffer. The study found that, by 2100, climate change-induced changes to vegetation, rainfall patterns and higher CO2 result in an average 1.3% reduction in gross domestic product, or GDP, across all the countries analyzed. It further found profound inequalities in the distribution of these impacts.
""Our research found that the world's poorest 50% of countries and regions are expected to bear a staggering 90% of the GDP damages,"" Bastien-Olvera said. ""In sharp contrast, the losses for the wealthiest 10% might be limited to just 2%.""
The authors said this is largely because lower-income countries tend to rely more on natural resources for their economic production, and a larger fraction of their wealth is in the form of natural capital.

Natural and economic values
For the study, the authors used global vegetation models, climate models and World Bank estimates of natural capital values to estimate the consequences of climate shifts on countries' ecosystem services, economic production and natural capital stocks.
These estimates may be conservative, as the analysis considered only land-based systems -- primarily forests and grasslands. Bastien-Olvera plans to address marine ecosystem impacts in future research. The study also didn't account for disturbances like wildfires or insect-driven tree mortality.
Accounting for nature
The overall findings underscore the importance of creating climate policies that account for the particular values each country derives from its natural systems.
""With this study, we're embedding natural systems and human well-being within an economic framework,"" said senior author Frances C. Moore, an associate professor in the UC Davis Department of Environmental Science and Policy. ""Our economy and well-being depend on these systems, and we should recognize and account for these overlooked damages when we consider the cost of a changing climate.""
The study was funded by the National Science Foundation.
""Thanks to the efforts of this research team, we now know that damage to ecosystems impacts human well-being in ways that are both measurable and wildly disproportionate across populations,"" said Jeffrey Mantz, NSF program officer. ""The results will be critical to abating economic losses in the coming decades.""

Climate change will alter the distribution of ecosystems around the world and change the flow of these benefits2,3. However, the specific implications of ecosystem changes for human welfare remain unclear, as they depend on the nature of these changes, the value of the affected benefits and the extent to which communities rely on natural systems for their well-being4. Here we estimate country-level changes in economic production and the value of non-market ecosystem benefits resulting from climate-change-induced shifts in terrestrial vegetation cover, as projected by dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) driven by general circulation climate models. Our results show that the annual population-weighted mean global flow of non-market ecosystem benefits valued in the wealth accounts of the World Bank will be reduced by 9.2% in 2100 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway SSP2-6.0 with respect to the baseline no climate change scenario and that the global population-weighted average change in gross domestic product (GDP) by 2100 is −1.3% of the baseline GDP.

Approximately 90% of these damages are borne by the poorest 50% of countries and regions, whereas the wealthiest 10% experience only 2% of these losses."

When plants are infected by pathogens, suffer from a lack of water or have to react to other external stimuli, the first thing they do is increase the proton and calcium concentration in the affected cells. The protons and calcium ions then act like messenger substances that trigger further reactions in the cell.

The interactions between protons and calcium ions in this process were previously largely unknown. An article in the journal Science by a team led by biophysicist Professor Rainer Hedrich from Julius-Maximilians-Universität (JMU) Würzburg in Bavaria, Germany, has now shed new light on this subject.
Using a sophisticated optogenetic approach, the researchers have discovered a previously unknown endogenous acid sensor in plant cells. And they have discovered in the guard cells of leaves that there is a calcium store that plays an important role in processing proton signals in cellular responses.
Why Such Simple Elements as Protons and Calcium Ions Act as Signals
In the course of evolution, cells have designed their metabolism to utilise energy-rich phosphates. This results in a problem: at the predominantly neutral cellular pH value, the valuable phosphates can be bound by calcium ions (Ca2+) and converted into an insoluble and therefore no longer usable form (calcium dihydrogen phosphate).
To avoid this, cells keep their internal calcium level very low; in their environment, however, it is 10,000 times higher. Outside the cells, the concentration of protons (H+) and therefore the acidity is also much higher. Due to this concentration gradient, both types of ions have a strong urge to flow into the cells -- making them ideal for use as messenger substances.
""The stimulus-dependent opening of calcium and proton channels in the cell membrane results in a temporary intracellular increase in both messenger ions,"" explains Rainer Hedrich. ""The cells understand this as a signal, which they translate into a biological reaction using calcium- and proton-binding enzymes.""
Light Switch Controls the Flow of Protons Into the Cell

How do plant cells react to the influx of protons and the associated acidification of their cell plasma? Until now, this could only be investigated with great experimental effort and even then only indirectly.
This is now much easier thanks to an appropriately equipped thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), which Hedrich's team has developed using optogenetic methods: A light-sensitive proton channel from a fungus, the channelrhodopsin KCR2, was optimised for use in plant cells. This means that protons can now be specifically sent into the cells in response to a light pulse.
Furthermore, they expressed KCR2 together with the genetically encoded pH reporter pHuji. This makes it very easy to measure the current pH value in the cell upon KCR2 activation.
Shouguang Huang, the first author of the Science publication, next scrutinised the guard cells of the new Arabidopsis mutant. ""When I stimulated them with blue light for a second, they depolarised, just as I had expected from a light-activated proton channel,"" says the researcher. During the subsequent experiments, the Würzburg ion channel specialists made a far-reaching discovery.
KCR2 Activation Acidifies the Cell and Causes Calcium to Rise
Their electrophysiological studies on guard cells showed that when the light stimulation began, the membrane potential immediately depolarised and the pH reporter pHuji signalled an acidification of the cell interior.

""However, we were astonished when the depolarisation and acidification continued for a good minute after the end of the light pulse,"" says Hedrich. ""This could only mean that the light activation of KCR2 and the acidification had activated the sphincter cell's own ion channels."" These are the long-known guard cell anion channels SLAC1 and SLAH3, whose activation, however, also requires the presence of calcium.
Endoplasmic Reticulum as a Calcium Store
""Taking all the facts together, it could be assumed that the proton currents carried by KCR2 and the associated acidification of the cell interior must also have generated a calcium signal,"" summarises the JMU professor.
His team was able to prove that the rapid acidification of the guard cells is followed by a calcium signal that lasts for 150 to 200 seconds. And they discovered that this calcium does not come from outside the cell, but is released from an endogenous store, the endoplasmic reticulum. This is a network of membrane tubes and cisterns that run through the cytoplasm.
Future studies will now focus on analysing the molecular nature of the H+-sensitive calcium channel of the endoplasmic reticulum and investigating its proton-activated on/off switch. Overall, these studies are important in order to better understand how plant cells react to external stimuli such as infections or drought.

We addressed this topic using the light-gated channelrhodopsin Hc KCR2 from the pseudofungus Hyphochytrium catenoides , which operates as a H + conductive, Ca 2+ impermeable ion channel on the plasma membrane of plant cells. Light activation of Hc KCR2 in Arabidopsis guard cells evokes a transient cytoplasmic acidification that sparks Ca 2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. A H + -induced cytosolic Ca 2+ signal results in membrane depolarization through the activation of Ca 2+ -dependent SLAC1/SLAH3 anion channels, which enabled us to remotely control stomatal movement. Our study suggests a H + -induced Ca 2+ release mechanism in plant cells and establishes Hc KCR2 as a tool to dissect the molecular basis of plant intracellular pH and Ca 2+ signaling."

The word ""drought"" typically conjures images of parched soil, dust-swept prairies, depleted reservoirs, and dry creek beds, all the result of weeks or seasons of persistently dry atmospheric conditions.

In the sun-soaked islands in the Caribbean, however, drought conditions can occur much more rapidly, with warning signs appearing too late for mediation strategies to limit agriculture losses or prevent stresses on infrastructure systems that provide clean water to communities.
Such occurrences -- known as flash droughts -- are the focus of a new paper authored by Assistant Professor Craig Ramseyer of the College of Natural Resources and Environment and published in the Journal of Hydrometeorology. The paper's finding is that Caribbean Islands are uniquely susceptible to sudden droughts, and Ramseyer advocates for alternative methodologies to more accurately measure dry conditions in the region.
""The tropics have extremely intense solar radiation, so atmospheric processes tend to be expedited,"" said Ramseyer, who teaches in the Department of Geography. ""Despite often receiving daily rainfall, island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to drought conditions.""
Ramseyer, whose research focuses on tropical rainfall and severe weather impacts in the Caribbean, utilized a new drought index that considers the atmospheric demand for moisture to identify drought risk conditions instead of more traditional soil moisture measurements.
""This new drought index is really developed to try to identify the first trigger of drought by focusing on evaporative demand,"" said Ramseyer, who collaborated on the paper with Paul Miller '12, M.S. '14, an assistant professor at Louisiana State University. ""Evaporative demand is a measure of how thirsty the atmosphere is and how much moisture it can collect from soil or plant matter.""
Ramseyer, who received funding for this research through a grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Program Office, stressed that identifying drying conditions earlier is a key step to limiting the impacts of droughts.

""A lot of drought observation is based on soil moisture, but in tropical environments, a decline in soil moisture is a response to other things that have already happened so you're further down in the chain of events,"" he said. ""We can mitigate a lot of losses in, say, agriculture, by being able to forecast sudden, anomalous increases in evaporative demand.""
The impacts of drought conditions extend beyond agriculture: Tropical ecosystems are also strongly impacted by dry atmospheric weather conditions, and access to fresh water is a necessity for both communities in the region and a tourism industry that is a central driver for economies in the Caribbean.
A new position for atmospheric research
To better understand how that interplay of meteorological patterns impacts drought conditions, Ramseyer utilized 40 years of data from a long-term ecological research project in the El Yunque National Forest. He found that flash droughts have routinely occurred in the Caribbean and that occurrences of drought are not limited to traditional dry seasons on the island.
""In terms of climate, Puerto Rico is situated at a crossroads, buffered on the west by the El Niño southern oscillation and by the cooler North Atlantic oscillation on the east,"" said Ramseyer. ""Because of that, Puerto Rico has a unique geography for researching atmospheric changes.""
The looming concerns over global warming have only accelerated the need for meteorologists to better understand drought occurrences in the Caribbean and enhance monitoring of moisture conditions in the region.

""A warming planet results in more moisture available in the atmosphere overall, which means that the kinds of short-term precipitation events common to the Caribbean will increase in intensity,"" said Ramseyer. ""Meanwhile, droughts are becoming higher in magnitude, so climate change is altering both extremes.""
Ramseyer, who helped secure Virginia Tech's membership in the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research this year, said developing clearer criteria for flash drought conditions is an important first step toward addressing the infrastructure challenges that Caribbean communities are likely to face.
""The key current and future issue for the Caribbean is all about finding a way to capture rainfall successfully and draw it out slowly to mitigate evaporation losses,"" said Ramseyer. ""Puerto Rico and all of the Caribbean have water infrastructure challenges that must be addressed to accommodate these trends.""
Geography department chair Tom Crawford said Ramseyer's paper reflects a utilization of big data in tackling climate and meteorological challenges.
""Dr. Ramseyer's research applies advanced computing and geospatial science to make significant contributions to the problem of flash droughts and precipitation variability broadly,"" said Crawford. ""In addition to his research impact, his course on Climate Data Analysis and Programming is training the next generation of researchers on cutting edge computational techniques applied to the changing climate.""
Ramseyer advocates for additional research into understanding the relationship between flash drought events and economic losses and how future drought events can be better communicated to stakeholders and communities.

Because these ecozones are acclimatized to receiving regular, near-daily precipitation, they are especially vulnerable to rapid-drying events. This is particularly true within the Caribbean Sea basin where numerous small islands lack the surface and groundwater resources to cope with swiftly developing drought conditions. This study fills the tropical flash drought gap by examining the pervasiveness of flash drought across the pan-Caribbean region using a recently proposed criterion based on the evaporative demand drought index (EDDI). The EDDI identifies 46 instances of widespread flash drought “outbreaks” in which significant fractions of the pan-Caribbean encounter rapid drying over 15 days and then maintain this condition for another 15 days. Moreover, a self-organizing maps (SOM) classification reveals a tendency for flash drought to assume recurring typologies concentrated in one of the Central American, South American, or Greater Antilles coastlines, although a simultaneous, Caribbean-wide drought is never observed within the 40-yr (1981–2020) period examined. Furthermore, three of the six flash drought typologies identified by the SOM initiate most often during Phase 2 of the Madden–Julian oscillation. Collectively, these findings motivate the need to more critically examine the transferability of flash drought definitions into the global tropics, particularly for small water-vulnerable islands where even island-wide flash droughts may only occupy a few pixels in most reanalysis datasets. The purpose of this study is to understand if flash drought occurs in tropical environments, specifically the Caribbean. Flash droughts represent a quickly evolving drought, which have particularly acute impacts on agriculture and often catch stakeholders by surprise as conditions evolve rapidly from wet to dry conditions. Our results indicate that flash droughts occur with regular periodicity in the Caribbean. Expansive flash droughts tend to occur in coherent subregional clusters. Future studies will further investigate the drivers of these flash droughts to create early warning systems for flash drought."

It has long been known that exposure to pesticide sprays is harmful to honey bees. In a new study, researchers have uncovered the effect of such sprays on the sense of smell in bees, which could disrupt their social signals.

Honey bees live in dynamic communities and constantly communicate with each other using chemicals that serve as social cues. For example, nurse bees -- that are responsible for taking care of larvae that ultimately become queens and worker bees -- constantly monitor the larvae using in the dark using pheromones. The larvae emit brood pheromones to indicate that they need food. There are also alarm pheromones that workers produce to warn the other bees of danger. If these cues are dampened or not perceived properly, the colony may fail to thrive.
Since 2007, scientists have known that honey bees have been in trouble. One of the stressors that have raised concerns are insecticides, which affect honey bee health. Because these are usually used in combination with other chemicals, the resulting mixture can become unexpectedly toxic to bees.
""For many years, it was assumed that fungicides do not have an adverse impact on insects because they are designed for fungal targets,"" said May Berenbaum (GEGC/IGOH), a professor of entomology. ""Surprisingly, in addition to insecticides, fungicides also have an adverse effect on bees and combining the two can disrupt colony function.""
For more than a decade, reports originating from almond orchards, where two-thirds of the U.S. honey bees are transported every year when the flowers are in bloom, implicated pesticide spray mixtures. In particular, the problem lies in the use of supposedly inactive chemicals called adjuvants, which increases the ""stickiness"" of the insecticide so it stays on the plants.
Because adjuvants have long been considered to be biologically benign, they are not subject to the same level of safety testing as other insecticidal agents. ""Recently, researchers have shown that adjuvants alone or when used in combination with fungicides and insecticides are toxic to bees,"" Berenbaum said.
Nurse bees are especially vulnerable to these combinations. ""The health of the queens is paramount,"" Berenbaum said. ""If healthy queens are not produced, the colony can suffer.""
To understand how combinations affect nurse bees, the researchers tested their effect on the olfactory system of honey bees using the adjuvant Dyne-Amic, the fungicide Tilt, and the insecticide Altacor.

The researchers divided bees into four groups of ten bees and for a week exposed them to either untreated commercial pollen or to pollen that had been treated with either Dyne-Amic, or Tilt and Altacor, or all three together. The bees were then anesthetized on ice and one antenna was carefully removed from each bee. The researchers then exposed the antenna to chemical mimics of brood and alarm pheromones and recorded the antenna's response using a technique called electroantennography.
With this method, Ling-Hsiu Liao, a research scientist, and Wen-Yen Wu, a graduate student, in the Berenbaum lab, found that when nurse bees had consumed pollen contaminated by the three chemicals, their antennal responses to some brood pheromones and alarm pheromones were altered. Their finding suggests that these commonly-used pesticides can interfere with honey bee communication.
How these chemicals interact and influence the bees is still unclear. ""There are many possible explanations for how consuming these chemicals can affect the sensory responses of bees,"" Liao said. ""The antenna detects and triggers the response to olfactory signals. In this study we did not look at what other changes are triggered, particularly changes in behavior.""
In addition to parsing out the underlying molecular pathways that are affected, the researchers are also interested in testing other mixtures of commonly used pesticides as well as looking at the response of bees in other populations. They hope that their work can help beekeepers rethink how they manage and protect their colonies.

Although adjuvants are generally considered to be biologically inert, some adjuvants have exhibited toxicity and sublethal effects, including decreasing survival rates of next-generation queens. Honey bees have a highly developed olfactory system to detect and discriminate among social signals. To investigate the impact of pesticide-adjuvant combinations on honey bee signal perception, we performed electroantennography assays to assess alterations in their olfactory responsiveness to the brood ester pheromone (BEP), the volatile larval pheromone β-ocimene, and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone. These assays aimed to uncover potential mechanisms underlying changes in social behaviors and reduced brood survival after pesticide exposure. We found that combining the adjuvant Dyne-Amic with the fungicide Tilt (propiconazole) and the insecticide Altacor (chlorantraniliprole) synergistically enhanced olfactory responses to three concentrations of BEP and as well exerted dampening and compensatory effects on responses to 2-heptanone and β-ocimene, respectively. In contrast, exposure to adjuvant alone or the combination of fungicide and insecticide had no effect on olfactory responses to BEP at most concentrations but altered responses to β-ocimene and 2-heptanone. Exposure to Dyne-Amic, Altacor, and Tilt increased BEP signal amplitude, indicating potential changes in olfactory receptor sensitivity or sensilla permeability to odorants. Given that, in a previous study, next-generation queens raised by nurses exposed to the same treated pollen experienced reduced survival, these new findings highlight the potential disruption of social signaling in honey bees and its implications for colony reproductive success."

Snacks constitute almost a quarter of a day's calories in U.S. adults and account for about one-third of daily added sugar, a new study suggests.

Researchers analyzing data from surveys of over 20,000 people found that Americans averaged about 400 to 500 calories in snacks a day - often more than what they consumed at breakfast - that offered little nutritional value.
Though dietitians are very aware of Americans' propensity to snack, ""the magnitude of the impact isn't realized until you actually look at it,"" said senior study author Christopher Taylor, professor of medical dietetics in the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences at The Ohio State University.
""Snacks are contributing a meal's worth of intake to what we eat without it actually being a meal,"" Taylor said. ""You know what dinner is going to be: a protein, a side dish or two. But if you eat a meal of what you eat for snacks, it becomes a completely different scenario of, generally, carbohydrates, sugars, not much protein, not much fruit, not a vegetable. So it's not a fully well-rounded meal.""
Survey participants who were controlling their type 2 diabetes ate fewer sugary foods and snacked less overall than participants without diabetes and those whose blood sugar levels indicated they were prediabetic.
""Diabetes education looks like it's working, but we might need to bump education back to people who are at risk for diabetes and even to people with normal blood glucose levels to start improving dietary behaviors before people develop chronic disease,"" Taylor said.
The study was published recently in PLOS Global Public Health.

Researchers analyzed data from 23,708 U.S. adults over 30 years of age who had participated from 2005 to 2016 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The survey collects 24-hour dietary recalls from each participant - detailing not just what, but when, all food was consumed.
Respondents were categorized according to their HbA1c level, a measure of glucose control, into four groups: nondiabetes, prediabetes, controlled diabetes and poorly controlled diabetes.
Among the whole survey sample, snacks accounted for between 19.5% and 22.4% of total energy intake - while contributing very little nutritional quality.
In descending order of proportion, snacks consisted of convenience foods high in carbohydrates and fats, sweets, alcoholic beverages, non-alcoholic drinks that include sugar-sweetened beverages, protein, milk and dairy, fruits, grains and, lagging far behind, vegetables.
Noting that capturing 24 hours of food consumption doesn't necessary reflect how people usually eat, ""it gives us a really good snapshot of a large number of people,"" Taylor said. ""And that can help us understand what's going on, where nutritional gaps might be and the education we can provide.""
Finding that people with diabetes had healthier snacking habits was an indicator that dietary education is beneficial to people with the disease. But it's information that just about everyone can use, Taylor said - and it's about more than just cutting back on sugar and carbs.

""We need to go from just less added sugar to healthier snacking patterns,"" he said. ""We've gotten to a point of demonizing individual foods, but we have to look at the total picture. Removing added sugars won't automatically make the vitamin C, vitamin D, phosphorus and iron better. And if we take out refined grains, we lose nutrients that come with fortification.
""When you take something out, you have to put something back in, and the substitution becomes just as important as the removal.""
And so, rather than offering tips on what foods to snack on, Taylor emphasizes looking at a day's total dietary picture and seeing whether snacks will fulfill our nutritional needs.
""Especially during the holidays, it's all about the environment and what you have available, and planning accordingly. And it's about shopping behavior: What do we have in the home?"" he said.
""We think about what we're going to pack for lunch and cook for dinner. But we don't plan that way for our snacks. So then you're at the mercy of what's available in your environment.""

When Santa's exhausted reindeer finally set down their sleigh in the deep snow of the North Pole early Christmas morning, it's not Rudolph's radiant red nose that will help them find sustenance in the barren landscape.

Instead, researchers from Dartmouth and the University of St. Andrews in Scotland report that the eyes of Rudolph and his reindeer brethren may have evolved so that they can spot their favorite food during dark and snowy Arctic winters, according to a new study in the journal i-Perception.
The findings help explain the long-standing scientific mystery as to why reindeer can see light in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum -- and add intrigue to the smiling airborne ungulates popularized in the classic story by 1926 Dartmouth graduate Robert L. May.
""Reindeer are so cool, but many people think about them only at Christmas,"" Nathaniel Dominy, first author of the study and the Charles Hansen Professor of Anthropology at Dartmouth says. ""Now is a good time to alert people to their extraordinary visual system.""
Reindeer subsist primarily on reindeer moss, or Cladonia rangiferina, which isn't a moss but actually a species of algae-fungus fusion known as lichen. C. rangiferina forms thick crunchy carpets across northern latitudes and is so integral to the survival of reindeer that even its formal name stems from the scientific term for reindeer, Rangifer.
The researchers worked in the Cairngorms mountains in the Scottish Highlands, which host Britain's only reindeer herd -- reintroduced from Scandinavia after being hunted to extinction locally -- and more than 1,500 species of lichen. Despite these options, reindeer in the Cairngorms rely on C. rangiferina during the winter.
""A peculiar trait of reindeer is their reliance on this one type of lichen,"" Dominy says. ""It's unusual for an any animal to subsist so heavily on lichens, let alone such a large mammal.""
To the human eye, the white lichen is invisible against the snowy backdrop of an Arctic winter.

But Dominy and co-authors Catherine Hobaiter and Julie Harris from St. Andrews discovered that C. rangiferina and a few other lichen species that supplement the reindeer diet absorb UV light. Spectral data from the lichen and light filters calibrated to mimic reindeer vision revealed that these organisms appear to reindeer as dark patches against an otherwise brilliant landscape, making them easier to locate.
""Getting a visual approximation of how reindeer might see the world is something other studies haven't done before,"" says Dominy, who published a paper in 2015 on how Rudolph's red nose would've acted as an effective foglamp in the haze of winter.
""If you can put yourself in their hooves looking at this white landscape, you would want a direct route to your food,"" he says. ""Reindeer don't want to waste energy wandering around searching for food in a cold, barren environment. If they can see lichens from a distance, that gives them a big advantage, letting them conserve precious calories at a time when food is scarce.""
Previous research has shown that reindeer eyes change between summer and winter, Dominy says. Their tapetum -- the light-enhancing membrane that gives many animals ""shiny"" eyes -- transitions in winter from the golden color most animals have to a vivid blue that is thought to amplify the low light of polar winter.
""If the color of the light in the environment is primarily blue, then it makes sense for the eye to enhance the color blue to make sure a reindeer's photoreceptors are maximizing those wavelengths,"" Dominy says.
But the blue tapetum also lets up to 60% of ultraviolet light pass through to the eye's color sensors. That means that reindeer see the winter world as a shade of purple, similar to how a person would see a room with a black light -- UV-reflecting surfaces such as snow shine brightly while UV-absorbing surfaces are starkly dark.

The researchers recount how scientists have sought to answer why the eyes of an Arctic animal that is active during the day would be receptive to the UV light that would be reflecting off of every snow-covered surface. But their study suggests that the answer is tied to what UV light doesn't reflect from -- C. rangiferina and other bushy lichens.
Given the importance of lichens in the reindeer diet, the researchers report, it is possible that the animal's eyes are optimized to single out this food staple at the time of year it would be most difficult to find.
So, while the luminescent nose of the most famous reindeer of all ""may light the way for Santa to see by,"" the researchers write, ""it is Rudolph's blue eyes that allow him to find dinner after a long Christmas season.""

These puzzling traits coexist with yet another enigma––ocular media that transmit up to 60% of ultraviolet (UV) light, enough to excite the cones responsible for color vision. It is unclear why any day-active circum-Arctic mammal would benefit from UV visual sensitivity, but it could improve detection of UV-absorbing lichens against a background of UV-reflecting snows, especially during the extended twilight hours of winter. To explore this idea and advance our understanding of reindeer visual ecology, we recorded the reflectance spectra of several ground-growing (terricolous), shrubby (fruticose) lichens in the diets of reindeer living in Cairngorms National Park, Scotland."

Rotavirus causes gastroenteritis, a condition that includes diarrhea, deficient nutrient absorption and weight loss. Severe cases result in approximately 128,000 deaths annually in infants and children worldwide. Despite intense research on how rotavirus causes diarrhea, there is still no complete answer, but in this new study researchers at Baylor College of Medicine report a new mechanism by which rotavirus induces diarrhea, interfering with the normal absorption of nutrients in the intestine.

The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to show that rotavirus-altered lipid metabolism in the intestine plays a role in the disease. Rotavirus infection leads to the degradation of DGAT1, an enzyme involved in normal lipid droplet formation in intestinal cells, which in turn reduces the production of key nutrient transporters and other proteins required for normal intestinal nutrient absorption, leading to diarrhea.
""We wanted to better understand how rotavirus exploits cellular processes to replicate,"" said co-corresponding author Dr. Sue E. Crawford, assistant professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor. ""We used the well-established monkey kidney cell (MA104) model of rotavirus infection as well as human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) for these studies. HIEs have revolutionized the study of gastrointestinal (GI) viruses like rotavirus. These multicellular, non-transformed cell cultures retain host genetic properties, cellular organization and recapitulate the function of the human gastrointestinal epithelium. They serve as biologically relevant model systems for studying human GI infections.""
""We knew that rotavirus triggers the formation of more lipid droplets than normal in the cells it infects, as it turns the lipid droplets into virus factories. While we were studying this process, we discovered that rotavirus binds to and breaks down or degrades DGAT1, an enzyme that contributes to the formation of the lipid droplets,"" Crawford said.
As the researchers looked deeper into DGAT1, they discovered that there are children who are born with mutations in DGAT1 that render the enzyme nonfunctional. ""These children have severe chronic diarrhea, which sometimes is fatal,"" said co-first author, Hunter Smith, graduate student in Dr. Mary Estes' and Crawford's lab at Baylor. ""This led us to think that rotavirus-mediated degradation of DGAT1 could be a mechanism by which the virus induces diarrhea.""
It was always thought that the virus caused diarrhea by infecting the intestinal cells that take up nutrients, killing them and consequently disrupting the nutrient absorption mechanisms of the intestine. ""But we found a new mechanism by which rotavirus induces diarrhea. Like the children who have a genetic DGAT1 deficiency that causes diarrhea, when rotavirus degrades DGAT1 the result is reduced production of the enzymes that are involved in degrading the food we eat and disruption of the mechanisms that transport nutrients into cells, which leads to diarrhea,"" Smith said.
""It was very unexpected that rotavirus has a protein that interacts with and degrades DGAT1 and that eliminating DGAT1 would lead to all these downstream effects that would cause diarrhea,"" Crawford said.
Mutations on DGAT1 in children and the link to diarrhea have been known in the last 10 years. ""Before that nobody would have said that there was any association between problems with this enzyme and diarrhea,"" said Estes, Distinguished Service Professor of Molecular Virology and Microbiology and Cullen Foundation Endowed Chair at Baylor. She also is a member of Baylor's Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center and co-corresponding author of this work with Crawford. ""It was very surprising that a rotavirus protein that until now was only known to be important for the virus to replicate, also plays a role in causing diarrhea, a major component of the disease. The fact that it's not a capsid protein or part of the structure that envelops the genetic material of the virus, as we usually would think, tells us that we should not assume that nonstructural proteins do not play roles in causing disease.""

RV-induced mechanisms that result in diarrhea are not completely understood, but malabsorption is a contributing factor. RV alters cellular lipid metabolism by inducing lipid droplet (LD) formation as a platform for replication factories named viroplasms. A link between LD formation and gastroenteritis has not been identified. We found that diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), the terminal step in triacylglycerol synthesis required for LD biogenesis, is degraded in RV-infected cells by a proteasome-mediated mechanism. RV-infected DGAT1-silenced cells show earlier and increased numbers of LD-associated viroplasms per cell that translate into a fourfold-to-fivefold increase in viral yield ( P < 0.05). Interestingly, DGAT1 deficiency in children is associated with diarrhea due to altered trafficking of key ion transporters to the apical brush border of enterocytes. Confocal microscopy and immunoblot analyses of RV-infected cells and DGAT1 −/− human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) show a decrease in expression of nutrient transporters, ion transporters, tight junctional proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins. Increased phospho-eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha) in DGAT1 −/− HIEs, and RV-infected cells, indicates a mechanism for malabsorptive diarrhea, namely inhibition of translation of cellular proteins critical for nutrient digestion and intestinal absorption. Our study elucidates a pathophysiological mechanism of RV-induced DGAT1 deficiency by protein degradation that mediates malabsorptive diarrhea, as well as a role for lipid metabolism, in the pathogenesis of gastroenteritis."

Researchers from the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History led a new analysis that sheds light on the ancestry and genetics of woolly dogs, a now extinct breed of dog that was a fixture of Indigenous Coast Salish communities in the Pacific Northwest for millennia. Anthropologist Logan Kistler and evolutionary molecular biologist Audrey Lin analyzed genetic clues preserved in the pelt of ""Mutton,"" the only known woolly dog fleece in the world, to pinpoint the genes responsible for their highly sought-after woolly fur.

The study's findings, published today, Dec. 14, in the journal Science, include interviews contributed by several Coast Salish co-authors, including Elders, Knowledge Keepers and Master Weavers, who provided crucial context about the role woolly dogs played in Coast Salish society.
""Coast Salish traditional perspective was the entire context for understanding the study's findings,"" said Kistler, the museum's curator of archaeobotany and archaeogenomics.
Coast Salish tribal nations in Washington state and British Columbia bred and cared for woolly dogs for thousands of years. Prized for their thick undercoats, the dogs were sheared like sheep and often kept in pens or on islands to carefully manage their breeding and to care for the canines' health and vitality. Coast Salish weavers used the dogs' wool to craft blankets and other woven items that served a variety of ceremonial and spiritual purposes. Woolly dogs themselves possessed spiritual significance and were often treated as beloved family members. As emblems for many Coast Salish communities, woolly dogs adorned woven baskets and other art forms.
By the mid-19th century, this once thriving dog wool-weaving tradition was in decline. In the late 1850s, naturalist and ethnographer George Gibbs cared for a woolly dog named Mutton. When Mutton died in 1859, Gibbs sent his pelt to the nascent Smithsonian Institution, where the fleece has resided ever since. However, few were aware of the pelt's existence until it was rediscovered in the early 2000s.
Lin first learned about Mutton when she was a Peter Buck postdoctoral fellow at the museum in 2021.
""When I saw Mutton in person for the first time, I was just overcome with excitement,"" said Lin, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at the American Museum of Natural History. ""I had heard from some other people that he was a bit scraggly, but I thought he was gorgeous.""
She was surprised to find out that virtually no work had been done on the genetics of woolly dogs, which disappeared around the turn of the 20th century. She teamed up with Kistler and they reached out to several Coast Salish communities to gauge their interest in working together on a potential research project on woolly dogs.

Many in the Coast Salish communities were eager to share their knowledge.
""We were very excited to participate in a study that embraces the most sophisticated Western science with the most established Traditional Knowledge,"" said Michael Pavel, an Elder from the Skokomish/Twana Coast Salish community in Washington, who remembers hearing about woolly dogs early in his childhood. ""It was incredibly rewarding to contribute to this effort to embrace and celebrate our understanding of the woolly dog.""
To complement the perspectives they received from Pavel and other Coast Salish people from British Columbia and Washington state (the text from their interviews is available in the study's supplementary materials), Lin, Kistler and their colleagues began analyzing Mutton's genetic code. They sequenced the woolly dog genome and compared it with the genomes of ancient and modern breeds of dogs to determine what set woolly dogs apart. They also identified certain chemical signatures called isotopes in Mutton's pelt to determine the dog's diet and teamed up with noted natural history illustrator Karen Carr to create a life-like reconstruction of what Mutton looked like in the 1850s. Carr's work is the first in-depth reconstruction of a Coast Salish woolly dog in nearly three decades.
Based on the genetic data, the team estimated that woolly dogs diverged from other breeds up to 5,000 years ago -- a date that lines up with archaeological remains from the region. They also discovered that Mutton was genetically similar to pre-colonial dogs from Newfoundland and British Columbia. The researchers estimate that nearly 85% of Mutton's ancestry can be linked to pre-colonial dogs. This ancient ancestry is surprising because Mutton lived decades after the introduction of European dog breeds. This makes it likely that Coast Salish communities continued to maintain woolly dogs' unique genetic makeup until right before the dogs were wiped out.
In total, the team analyzed more than 11,000 different genes in Mutton's genome to determine what gave woolly dogs their fluffy fleece and wool fibers that could be spun together to create yarn. They identified 28 genes that have links to hair growth and follicle regeneration. These included a gene that causes a woolly hair phenotype in humans, and another linked to curly hair in other dogs. Similar genes were even activated in the genomes of woolly mammoths.
However, Mutton's genetics could tell the researchers little about what caused the dogs to decline. Traditionally, scholars have speculated that the arrival of machine-made blankets to the region in the early 19th century made woolly dogs expendable. But insights from Pavel and other traditional experts revealed that it was improbable that such a central part of Coast Salish society could be replaced.

Instead, woolly dogs were likely doomed by numerous factors impacting the Coast Salish tribal nations after European settlers arrived. Due to disease and colonial policies of cultural genocide, displacement and forced assimilation, it likely became increasingly difficult or forbidden for Coast Salish communities to maintain their woolly dogs.
""It was thousands of years of very careful maintenance lost within a couple of generations,"" Lin said.
But despite their disappearance, the memory of woolly dogs is still embedded into Coast Salish society. And Pavel thinks their understanding of woolly dogs is only getting clearer thanks to the new research effort.
""All of our communities held a certain aspect of knowledge about the woolly dog,"" Pavel said. ""But when woven together, as a result of participating in this study, we now have a much more complete understanding.""

An international team of scientists led by geneticists and disease biologists from the University of Oxford and LMU Munich have used ancient DNA to trace the evolution of Marek's Disease Virus (MDV). This global pathogen causes fatal infections in unvaccinated chickens and costs the poultry industry over $1 billion per year. The findings, published today in the journal Science, show how viruses evolve to become more virulent and could lead to the development of better ways to treat viral infections.

The team, which includes archaeologists and biologists, recovered and reconstructed ancient MDV sequences from archaeological chickens spanning the past 1,000 years. By comparing viral genomes derived from both modern and ancient birds, they were able to pinpoint the genetic alterations responsible for the increased virulence of the modern virus.
Based on the ancient genetic sequences, they were also able to resurrect ancient biological processes using cellular assays, demonstrating that ancient strains were significantly milder than their modern counterparts.
This breakthrough not only sheds light on the evolutionary history of MDV, but also holds promise for the development of more effective therapies against this devastating poultry disease.
This new study is based on DNA isolated from chicken bones that were excavated from 140 archaeological sites in Europe and the Near East. These ancient genomes revealed that MDV was widespread in European chickens at least 1,000 years before the disease was first described in 1907. This highlights the importance of preserving archaeological remains, especially given their power to reveal valuable insights into the evolution of virulence.
When first described, this disease only led to mild symptoms in older chickens. As chicken consumption dramatically increased in the 1950s and 1960s, MDV has continued to evolve and has become increasingly aggressive despite the development of several vaccines.
First author Dr Steven Fiddaman (Department of Biology, University of Oxford) said: ""Our findings not only unravel the evolutionary history of the Marek's Disease Virus but also provide a foundation for enhancing our current understanding of pathogen virulence. By combining ancient DNA techniques with modern genomics, we've opened a window into the past that can guide future strategies in managing viral diseases.""
Professor Naomi Sykes (University of Exeter), lead archaeologist on the study, stated: ""This study underscores the profound significance of biological material preserved in archaeological and museum collections since we cannot foresee how their investigation might possess transformative applications in the future.""

Professor Laurent Frantz (LMU Munich), co-senior author of the study stated: ""Our work highlights the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together paleogeneticists, virologists, archaeologists, and biologists to unravel the complex evolutionary history of a pathogen with significant economic and agricultural implications.""
Professor Greger Larson (University of Oxford), co-senior author commented: ""We have seen how mitigating diseases often creates a selection pressure that increases the virulence of the virus. Being able to watch this process take place by sequencing ancient virus genomes shows just how dramatically the virulence of MDV has increased in the past century.""
Professor Adrian Smith (Department of Biology, University of Oxford), co-senior author said: ""Ancient DNA has provided us with a unique perspective on the emergence of MDV as a deadly chicken virus and may teach us lessons that are applicable to the control of other viral infections of medical and veterinary importance.""
Professor Venugopal Nair, Scientist Emeritus at The Pirbright Institute, said: ""Findings from this paper on the origins of virulence, particularly associated with the genetic sequences of the ancient Marek's disease viruses, will provide great scientific opportunities to explore the molecular mechanisms of increasing virulence of this virus that coincided with the intensification of poultry farming from the 1960s.""

By sequencing MDV genomes derived from archeological chickens, we demonstrate that it has been circulating for at least 1000 years. We functionally tested the Meq oncogene, one of 49 viral genes positively selected in modern strains, demonstrating that ancient MDV was likely incapable of driving tumor formation.

The human gut is home to hundreds of different bacterial species collectively known as the gut microbiome. A major health benefit these provide is to protect the gut against invading pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) that could cause harmful infections. But up to now, how this protective effect comes about has been unclear, and whether certain bacterial species have a more important role than others.

To investigate this, researchers at the University of Oxford tested 100 different gut bacteria strains individually and in combination for their ability to limit the growth of two harmful bacterial pathogens: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella enterica. Individual gut bacteria showed a very poor ability to restrict the spread of either pathogen. But when communities of up to 50 species were cultured together, the pathogens grew up to 1000 times less effectively than when cultured with any individual species. This 'community protection effect' was seen regardless of whether the bacteria were cultured together in vials, or in 'germ-free' mice (which had no resident gut bacteria at the start of the experiments).
Author Professor Kevin Foster (Departments of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Oxford) said: 'These results clearly demonstrate that colonization resistance is a collective property of microbiome communities; in other words, a single strain is protective only when in combination with others.'
However, the researchers found that the members of the bacterial communities -- and not just the overall diversity -- had a critical effect on the level of protection. Certain species were found to be essential for community-based protection, even though these species offered little protection on their own.
The researchers demonstrated that protective bacterial communities block pathogen growth by consuming the nutrients that the pathogen needs. By assessing the genomes of the different bacterial species, they found that the most protective communities were composed of species with highly similar protein compositions to the pathogenic species. They also used metabolic profiling to demonstrate that the protective species had similar demands for carbon sources as the pathogens.
Author Frances Spragge (Departments of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Oxford) added: 'Crucially, although increased microbiome diversity increases the probability of protection against these pathogens, the overlap in nutrient utilization profiles between the community and the pathogen is key. Certain species that have a crucial role in community protection show a high degree of metabolic overlap with the pathogen, and therefore similar nutrient demands.'
The researchers used this nutrient blocking principle to predict communities of bacteria that would offer weak and strong protection against a different pathogen: an antimicrobial resistant E. coli strain. When tested experimentally, the communities which had the highest nutrient overlap with the E. coli strain were up to 100-fold more effective at reducing the pathogen's abundance than the communities predicted to give weak protection.
According to the researchers, these new insights could be developed into novel strategies to combat harmful gut pathogens through optimising gut microbiome communities. They may also explain why individuals can become more susceptible to species such as K. pneumoniae after taking antibiotic treatments that can lower the diversity of gut microbiome species.
Author Dr Erik Bakkeren (Departments of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Oxford) added: 'Our work supports the general hypothesis that a more diverse microbiome can carry health benefits. This gives promise to the goal of optimising the composition of microbiomes to protect against bacterial species that are harmful to health.'

We studied how human gut bacteria influence colonization of two major bacterial pathogens, both in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Whereas single species alone had negligible effects, colonization resistance greatly increased with community diversity. Moreover, this community-level resistance rested critically upon certain species being present. We explained these ecological patterns through the collective ability of resistant communities to consume nutrients that overlap with those used by the pathogen. Furthermore, we applied our findings to successfully predict communities that resist a novel target strain. Our work provides a reason why microbiome diversity is beneficial and suggests a route for the rational design of pathogen-resistant communities."

An effective HIV vaccine may need to prompt strong responses from immune cells called CD8+ T cells to protect people from acquiring HIV, according to a new study from researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues. The study findings, appearing in Science, draw comparisons between the immune system activity of past HIV vaccine study participants and people with HIV who naturally keep the virus from replicating even in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The latter individuals are often called ""long-term non-progressors"" or ""elite controllers"" (LTNPs/ECs).

When HIV enters the body, the virus begins to damage the immune system by inserting itself into CD4+ T cells, which are white blood cells that help coordinate the immune response to pathogens. In most people, HIV continues to replicate and damage more and more CD4+ T cells unless controlled by ART. Among LTNPs/ECs, the immune system appears to promptly recognize CD4+ cells with HIV and activate other immune cells called CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells destroy CD4+ cells with HIV, enabling the suppression of HIV in a person's blood.
The aim of an effective HIV vaccine is to provide durable protective immunity to HIV, or if initial defenses are bypassed, to help control HIV in the body long term, as happens with LTNPs/ECs. Although several preventive HIV vaccine candidates have been designed to stimulate CD8+ T-cell activity, they did not prevent HIV acquisition or control viral replication in clinical trials. Understanding and addressing this lack of effect is a scientific priority of HIV vaccine research.
Scientists in the HIV-Specific Immunity Section of NIAID's Laboratory of Immunoregulation and colleagues designed their study to better understand which CD8+ T-cell functions were lacking in previous HIV vaccine recipients. They compared laboratory samples from previous HIV vaccine study participants with samples from LTNPs/ECs. They found that both HIV vaccine recipients and LTNPs/ECs generated large numbers of CD8+ T cells that recognized HIV. However, unlike the CD8+ T cells of LTNPs/ECs, HIV vaccine recipients' CD8+ T cells failed to deliver the proteins necessary to destroy HIV-infected CD4+ T cells with HIV.
Further tests suggested this dampened response was due to reduced sensitivity to HIV of vaccine recipients' T-cell receptors -- the part of a CD8+ T cell that detects a CD4+ T cell with HIV. This reduced T-cell receptor sensitivity suggests the vaccine candidates from several prior studies did not sufficiently stimulate the maturation of CD8+ T cells to recognize, reach, and destroy all CD4+ T cells with HIV in a person's body.
According to the authors, the study suggests that future HIV vaccine candidates may be more successful if they include additional doses or persist longer in the body to further stimulate the immune system. They also write that the potential of an HIV vaccine might be better judged by measuring how it affects CD8+ T-cell function and sensitivity in addition to just assessing the number of CD8+ T cells generated, which has been the usual practice.
These findings build on decades of research by the HIV-Specific Immunity Section of NIAID's Laboratory of Immunoregulation to better understand the immune response to HIV. The insights from this work may help guide future preventive and therapeutic HIV vaccine design and development, as well as HIV immunotherapy approaches.
Editorial note: While the terms ""elite controller"" and ""long-term non-progressor"" are used in scientific settings, the HIV research community is working to identify person-first language as a possible alternative to these phrases.

The functions of vaccine-induced HIV-specific CD8 + T cells were investigated here in detail. Cytotoxic capacity was significantly lower than in HIV controllers and was not a consequence of low frequency or unaccumulated functional cytotoxic proteins. Low cytotoxic capacity was attributable to impaired degranulation in response to the low antigen levels present on HIV-infected targets. The vaccine-induced T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire was polyclonal and transduction of these TCRs conferred the same reduced functions. These results define a mechanism accounting for poor antiviral activity induced by these vaccines and suggest that an effective CD8 + T cell response may require a vaccination strategy that drives further TCR clonal selection.

Gastrulation is one of the most important phases in early embryonic development. Before gastrulation, vertebrate embryos are simple two-dimensional sheets of cells. By the end of gastrulation, an embryo will have begun to differentiate distinct cell types, set up the basic axes of the body and internalize some of the precursors for organs in a three-dimensional structure. Amniotes, like chickens and humans, will have developed a primitive streak, the precursor to the brain and skin, while fish and amphibians will have developed a spherical-shaped blastopore.

Gastrulation is a feat of self-organization, requiring the ballet-like coordinated movements of hundreds to tens of thousands of cells. But, despite its importance in development, scientists only partially understand the underlying mechanisms that coordinate this large-scale movement of cells.
Now a team of researchers from the Harvard, the University of California San Diego and the University of Dundee in the U.K., have developed a theoretical framework that can reproduce and predict the patterns associated with gastrulation in a chicken embryo.
Building on their experimental findings published earlier this year in Science Advances, and using a combination of theory and experiment, the researchers demonstrated that small changes in cell parameters and behavior can have a dramatic impact on the resulting gastrulation patterns.
The new research was also published in Science Advances.
""Linking the developmental processes underlying morphogenesis in an organism to the variations of these same processes across evolution is an old question in biology,"" said L. Mahadevan, the Lola England de Valpine Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and of Physics in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) and senior author of the paper. ""Moving away from the gene-centric molecular focus on this question, we asked if there are emergent biophysical principles that operate on the multi-cellular level and can help explain the self-organized gastrulation patterns from both a developmental and an evolutionary perspective.""
Working closely with experimentalists, the researchers developed a theoretical and computational model that could recreate the movement of the epithelial layer of cells in chick embryos during gastrulation. The team then identified two parameters -- one related to the initial distribution of cells in an embryo and the other related to cell behavior -- to tweak during gastrulation.

""When we changed these two parameters in the model, which was only informed by the mechanisms of chick development, it remarkably showed gastrulation patterns naturally seen in other species,"" said Mattia Serra, first author of the paper and former Schmidt Science fellow in the Mahadevan group.
Serra is an Assistant Professor in Physics at UC San Diego.
Consistent with the computational results, experiments show that perturbing the same parameters in vivo in a chick embryo caused the chick to form a disk-like blastopore, seen in frogs, a ring-like circular primitive streak, like those seen in fish, or an elongated elliptical canal-like streak seen in chameleon.
""Our work suggests that the general biophysical principles underlying active self-organized flows and forces during embryogenesis have the power to explain developmental processes and their evolutionary variations across different species of vertebrates,"" said Mahadevan.
""We were surprised to see how simple mechanochemical rules could predict highly distinct coherent flows of thousands of cells measured in a living chick embryo,"" said Serra.
This research not only sheds light on the principles for self- organization in early development but could also help researchers understand the evolutionary history of developmental processes and suggest ways to control the development of synthetic organoids.
This research looked at the early stages of development, when the embryo is just transforming from two-dimensions into three. Next, Mahadevan wants to understand what happens when the embryo starts to fold and buckle to create the more complex shapes of organs and eventually whole organisms.
""Using our knowledge of developmental processes at the molecular and cellular level, we eventually hope to provide an integrated framework for how cells form into tissues and tissues into organs, towards a better understanding of morphogenesis,"" said Mahadevan.

This process requires the coordinated movements of hundreds to tens of thousands of cells, depending on the organism. In the chick embryo, patterns of actomyosin cables spanning several cells drive coordinated tissue flows. Here, we derive a minimal theoretical framework that couples actomyosin activity to global tissue flows. Our model predicts the onset and development of gastrulation flows in normal and experimentally perturbed chick embryos, mimicking different gastrulation modes as an active stress instability. Varying initial conditions and a parameter associated with active cell ingression, our model recapitulates distinct vertebrate gastrulation morphologies, consistent with recently published experiments in the chick embryo. Altogether, our results show how changes in the patterning of critical cell behaviors associated with different force-generating mechanisms contribute to distinct vertebrate gastrulation modes via a self-organizing mechanochemical process."

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is extremely common, affecting nearly two-thirds of the world's population, according to the World Health Organization.

Once inside the body, HSV establishes a latent infection that periodically awakens, causing painful blisters on the skin, typically around the nose and mouth. While a mere nuisance for most people, HSV can also lead to dangerous eye infections and brain inflammation in some people and cause life-threatening infections in newborns.
Researchers have long known that the virus and the host immune system are in a perpetual competition, but why does this battle reach a stasis in most people while causing serious infections in others?
More important, precisely how does the battle unfold at the level of cells and molecules? This question has continued to bedevil scientists and hamper the quest for treatments that prevent or cure infections.
A recent study by researchers at Harvard Medical School, conducted using lab-engineered cells and published in PNAS, unveils the precise maneuvers used by host and pathogen in the fight for dominance of the cell.
Furthermore, the research shows how the immune system keeps the virus at bay in a battle taking place at the control center of the cell -- its nucleus.
Immune signaling proteins issue a call to arms
The research reveals a key role for a group of signaling proteins called interferons, which recruit other protective molecules and block the virus from establishing infection.

Once inside the host, HSV multiplies by making copies of itself inside the nuclei of cells, using the host's genetic machinery. For that to happen, the virus must outcompete the host's immune system. But many of the tactics the virus and the immune system use in this contest have remained a mystery, making it challenging to design medicines to help patients defeat the virus.
Interferons -- named for their ability to interfere with pathogens' attempts to infect cells -- are signaling molecules released when the immune system detects the presence of microbes, such as viruses. The distress signals sent by interferons activate genes in that cell and other cells that produce proteins, which in turn block viruses from establishing infection in the first place.
Several different mechanisms that interferons use to thwart viruses within the cytoplasm, the gelatinous liquid that fills cells, are well known. But how interferons work against DNA viruses -- those launching their attack within the cell nucleus -- has remained elusive.
""We know a lot about how interferon and immune stimulants work against viruses in the cytoplasmic body of the cell, but up until now, we knew very little about how the immune system blocks viral infection in the cell's nucleus,"" said study senior author David Knipe, the Higgins Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS. ""Our findings define the mechanisms of action of any treatment that induces interferons and how they can prevent and treat infections from HSV, as well as other herpesviruses and nuclear DNA viruses.""
Knipe said the insights from this work could also help researchers understand -- and perhaps eventually develop treatments for -- other nuclear DNA viruses, including well-known troublemakers like the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis; human papillomavirus; hepatitis B; and smallpox.
These results define the mechanisms of action of interferon treatments for herpesvirus diseases and other treatments such as toll-like receptor ligands that have been tested for herpes, the researchers said. Other new activators of interferons such as cGAS agonists could also be used to induce herpes resistance through the newly defined mechanisms, the researchers added.

The researchers caution that any new potential therapies for HSV and other DNA viruses are purely conceptual at this point. Any such approaches should be first tested in small animals such as mice, then in larger animals and, finally, in humans.
Mapping the steps of a viral arms race
In the new study, Knipe and co-author Catherine Sodroski, an HMS PhD graduate now at the National Institutes of Health, discovered that a host protein called IFI16 is recruited by interferon to help block the virus from reproducing in several ways.
One of the strategies used by IFI16 to fend off HSV involves building and maintaining a shell of molecules around the viral DNA genome. This molecular ""bubble wrap"" prevents the virus from unfurling. With the virus wrapped up, it can't activate its DNA to express its genes and make copies of itself.
To counter these protective maneuvers, however, the virus produces molecules called VP16 and ICP0 that can remove the wrapping, deactivate the host cell's protective molecules, and enable the virus to reproduce.
Another mechanism used by IFI16 to fight HSV infection is to neutralize VP16 and ICP016. Under normal circumstances, when the cell is not preparing to repel a viral invader, there is some IFI16 present within the nucleus. But this background level of IFI16 isn't enough to fight off the viral helper proteins and keep the virus wrapped and restrained.
Without interferon's call to the cell to send in more IFI16, the virus wins the arms race and infects the cell. However, the experiments showed, when interferon signals recruit higher levels of IFI16, the immune system wins.
This current study echoes similar findings that found elevated levels of IFI16 in clinical samples of tissues where the immune system appeared to be successfully controlling symptoms of the closely related HSV-2 virus, providing crucial insights about the molecular machinery at work in staving off outbreaks of symptoms.
Using insights from the lab to improve human health
Knipe says he became interested in the biology of herpesviruses as an undergraduate while recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. He turned that curiosity into a career.
The Knipe lab studies what happens at the level of molecules and cells when HSV causes symptomatic and dormant infections. He is particularly interested in how the host immune system responds to HSV. Knipe has applied the insights gained by studying HSV to explore the possibilities of using genetic material from HSV to deliver vaccines for HIV, SARS, West Nile, and anthrax.
""Solving the puzzles that underlie the basic biology of how these viruses interact with the host cell nucleus and immune system is endlessly fascinating, and finding new ways to apply that knowledge to fighting diseases is endlessly rewarding,"" Knipe said. ""The most exciting part is that we're just scratching the surface of the deep knowledge we can tap into for this fight.""

The mechanisms of action of a number of cytoplasmic ISGs have been well defined, but little is known about the mechanism of action of nuclear ISGs. Constitutive levels of nuclear interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) serve to induce innate signaling and epigenetic silencing of herpes simplex virus (HSV), but only when the HSV infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) E3 ligase, which promotes IFI16 degradation, is inactivated. In this study, we found that following IFN induction, the pool of IFI16 within the infected cell remains high and can restrict wild-type viral gene expression and replication due to both the induced levels of IFI16 and the IFI16-mediated repression of ICP0 levels. Restriction of viral gene expression is achieved by IFI16 promoting the maintenance of heterochromatin on the viral genome, which silences it epigenetically. These results indicate that a nuclear ISG can restrict gene expression and replication of a nuclear DNA virus by maintaining or preventing the removal of repressive heterochromatin associated with the viral genome."
