An archaeological find in the Huescan Pyrenees allowed researchers to identify for the first time livestock management strategies and feeding practices which demonstrate how the first high mountain societies, at the start of the Neolithic period, were already carrying out complex livestock and farming activities, instead of being limited to the transhumance of sheep and goats. The study has been the first to combine carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis with archaeozoological analyses. The study, coordinated by the UAB and including the involvement of the CSIC, the University of Évora and the Government of Aragon, also documented how the economic importance of pigs in the Huescan region dates back to the Neolithic.

The research on management strategies and use of animal resources in high mountain areas during the Early Neolithic, approximately 6,500 to 7,500 years ago, was conditioned by the presumption that human occupancy of these regions were mainly seasonal and that economic practices focused greatly on making use of wild resources. With regards to livestock rearing, the role of sheep and goat transhumance in high mountain areas has stood out traditionally, while only a marginal role has been given to other livestock activities, in which the temporary maintenance of these animal flocks has been highlighted.
Researchers from the Archaeozoology Laboratory and the High Mountain Archaeology Group of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), the University of Évora (HERCULES Laboratory), the Milà i Fontanals Institution-CSIC and the General Directorate of Cultural Heritage of the Government of Aragon, have now for the first time managed to characterise the livestock practices and feeding strategies of domesticated animals in high mountain regions during the Early Neolithic, specifically in the archaeological site of Coro Trasito, located in the region of Sobrarbe, Aragon. Their research has yielded new elements to be used in the study of the complexity of neolithisation processes in the Central Pyrenees.
The study conducted by the research team focused on assessing animal ecology, livestock management strategies and feeding practices implemented by the first societies settling in high mountain regions (over 1,500 metres above sea level). To do so, the team became the first to apply to high mountain contexts a combination of analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in bone collagen -- the study of these two isotopes can be used to determine the diet and the position in the food chain of the animals -- and the archaeozoological analysis of the remains of animals from that period. Thanks to this combination, researchers were able to document that management and feeding strategies differed among flocks.
The results obtained showed that flocks belonging to these first settlers were small and formed by a few number of each species: cows, goats, sheep and pigs (Bos taurus, Capra hircus, Ovis aries and Sus domesticus), and were mainly used for their meat and milk production. In addition, researchers were able to document the rise in the economic importance of pigs (Sus domesticus) during the Neolithic.
The presence in some of the cases studied of different ways of managing the feeding of animals, with access to different pastures and the possible provision of forage, mainly from surplus agricultural products, shows that livestock practices developed at the Coro Trasito site were consolidated practices at the start of the Neolithic and related to agricultural practices. The study also demonstrates how flocks were adapted to the environmental conditions of the cave.
The results of the archaeozoological, isotopic and archaeological analyses reveal that the inhabitants of the Coro Trasito cave made use mainly of domestic resources. In addition, the presence of transformation activities related to dairy products and fat, as well as the existence of storage structures within the cave, point to the complexity of neolithisation processes in the Central Pyrenees and how these areas were rapidly integrated into an even wider and more complex economic system.

The results obtained in the framework of research developed recently on settlement dynamics during the early Neolithic in the highland areas indicate the existence of relatively permanent occupations and the exploitation of domestic resources. Regarding livestock, the role of caprine transhumance in highland areas has been highlighted traditionally, conferring a marginal role to husbandry activities and emphasizing principally the temporary maintenance of herds of sheep and goats. In this study, we use the archaeozoological data and δ13C and δ15N stable isotopes composition of the faunal bones collagen to characterize the husbandry practices in Coro Trasito cave (Huesca, Spain). The results obtained demonstrated the presence of diverse herd foddering strategies within husbandry practices characterized by taxonomic diversity and multipurpose exploitation suggests that during the Neolithic, Coro Trasito cave played a more complex role than sheepfold. Moreover, the presence of the four main domestic species indicates the adaptation of herds of Coro Trasito to the cave environment, flocks with diverse dietary needs and reproductive behaviors. The results are discussed with an integrated analysis of the data related to animal management strategies in highland areas (more than 1,500 m. asl) during the early Neolithic, in particular in the central Pyrenees area. This study offers new elements to study the complexity of neolithization processes in the central Pyrenees and how these areas were quickly integrated into a broader economic system."

They'd been in the collections of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) since the 1870s when they were first discovered. Nestled in among the largest collection of trilobites, the unique fossils rested in drawers until 145 years later when Sarah Losso, PhD candidate in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB) at Harvard, began combing through the collection of trilobites as part of her dissertation.

""I started my PhD going through all of these thin sections of trilobites, imaging them, and trying to figure what we can actually see,"" Losso said. ""And then I came across something we never see in trilobite fossils.""
In a new study, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, lead author Losso describes the unusual three-dimensional trilobite fossils prepared as thin sections showing the 3D soft tissues during enrollment. The study reveals the soft undersides of enrolled trilobites and the evolutionary mechanism that allows arthropods to enroll their bodies for protection from predators and adverse environmental conditions.
Trilobites are early arthropods from the Paleozoic Era. They were numerous and super diverse until they were wiped out in the End Permian mass extinction. Trilobites are named for their three-lobed body, which is covered by a durable exoskeleton enriched in calcite that is easily preserved; making trilobites an iconic part of the Paleozoic fossil record. Their segmented bodies have numerous limb pairs that include a walking leg and a gill for respiration. Unlike their durable exoskeleton, their undersides, including the legs, are much softer so are rarely fossilized unless the perfect conditions are met. Trilobites have no close relatives, despite their resemblance to horseshoe crabs. However, horseshoe crabs can serve as a useful comparison because of their similar lifestyle.
The challenges associated with fossilizing soft tissues make the trilobites Losso studied even more special. The fossils are from the Mohawkian Stage of the Ordovician Period (462-451 million years ago). They were discovered in the Walcott-Rust Quarry located in upstate New York near Trenton Falls; a region originally inhabited by the Iroquois tribe. The quarry is named in part after the scientist Charles D. Walcott, who discovered the enrolled trilobites there in his youth, before going on to famously discover the Burgess Shale while Director of the Smithsonian Institution.
The fossils, which Walcott sold to the MCZ and the Smithsonian in the 1870s, were trapped in a sediment slurry that quickly moved downslope and entombed the trilobites, leading to the preservation of delicate tissues before decay destroyed them. They are unusual in that the soft tissues, such as legs and antennae, are preserved in 3D. Walcott studied the fossils by cutting them into sections of paper-thin slices of rock and attaching them to glass slides using balsam sap. Though doing the best with what was available at the time, Walcott's method of preparation makes the fossils difficult to study, because 3D structures are being seen as a 2D plane.
""These were the first known complete trilobite appendages,"" said Losso, ""before their discovery in the late 1800s, scientists knew of the walking leg, but not what the gill branches looked like."" Because of the environmental disturbance, the trilobites enrolled to protect their more delicate appendages. Sediment then surrounded the legs of the partially enrolled trilobites, creating a mold of the external shape even while the tissues decayed.

Enrollment occurs in many different organisms. It is a defense strategy for animals with hard exoskeletons and softer tissues on their underside. We see enrollment in modern animals including pill bugs (isopods), pill millipedes (millipedes), and even armadillos. By enrolling their bodies, these animals can protect their vulnerable soft tissues with their hard exoskeletons from predators. In modern terrestrial arthropods, it can also protect against desiccation and loss of moisture.
While the mechanics of trilobite enrollment are well studied, these observations have only been made by examining their exoskeletons due to a lack of enrolled fossils with soft tissue preservation. Of the 20,000 species of trilobites, fewer than 40 have soft tissue preservation. And of those 40, most only preserve parts of a leg or antenna. Only a dozen species have known complete appendages, yet most of those are preserved as highly compressed, flat fossils, as is seen in the Burgess Shale from British Columbia.
""These fossils give us the first clear view of the three-dimensional organization of trilobite soft tissues, as well as the first molds of trilobites in different stages of enrollment, which allowed us to actually see how they moved their appendages and other structures in order to enroll,"" Losso said.
Trilobites and other arthropods have rows of dorsal exoskeletal plates on their back and undersides. The plates on the back, called tergites, are reinforced and much larger than the plates on the undersides. The sternites are a row of rigid plates along the underside and are softer and more prone to decay, so are rarely seen in the fossil record. The Walcott-Rust fossils, however, had preserved ventral structures including the sternites and limbs.
Though on the softer side, the sternites are too long and rigid for the animal to enroll if they cannot flex or articulate. To get around this, the sternites actually slide past each other in a dipping motion, similar to window blinds, which allows their body to scrunch up into a ball. Trilobite legs have also adapted to allow for this movement by evolving into a wedge shape that can fit together like pizza slices inside the enrolled ball.
""Because the part of the leg that attaches to the body is rarely seen, and certainly not in 3D, people frequently represented it as oval or squarish in cross-section,"" Losso said, ""but oval or square legs would not allow for the flexibility needed for full enrollment.""
Losso compared the Walcott-Rust fossils to CT scans of modern arthropods of millipedes, isopods, and horseshoe crabs, which were also housed in the MCZ collections. Losso found that modern arthropods used the same movement of sternites as we see in trilobites to enroll their bodies. Trilobites have been found throughout the Paleozoic Era. The adaptation to enroll allowed them to thrive, and they evolved structures to aid in enrollment such as the correct proportions and number of segments in the ventral to keep the body enrolled and wedge-shaped legs.
""The fossils have been known for a long time, but no one had put it together that we could study the ventral adaptations for enrollment using these really great fossils,"" Losso said. ""These fossils allowed us to compare trilobites with modern arthropods and see that there is really only one way to accomplish enrollment given the arthropod body plan. It's a great example of convergent evolution amongst all these different lineages, and across a huge swath of time because we're seeing this in the Ordovician and today. It's an important strategy for survival that thrives today.""
""Sarah's work has greatly improved our understanding of a key behavioral strategy that made trilobites incredibly successful for over 200 million years, and also brings new attention to the historical collections of Walcott-Rust fossils at the MCZ that went unstudied over 100 years,"" said senior author Javier Ortega-Hernández, Assistant Professor in OEB and Curator of Invertebrate Paleontology at the MCZ. ""The new data on the three-dimensional morphology of trilobites during enrollment will allow us to accurately model this complex strategy for the first time, and represent a beautiful example of convergent evolution in action across distantly related species.""

Enrolment is a staple habit of trilobites, and their biomineralized dorsal exoskeleton offered a versatile substrate for the evolution of interlocking devices. However, it is unknown whether trilobites also featured ventral adaptations for enrolment. Here, we report ventral exoskeletal adaptations that facilitate enrolment in exceptionally preserved trilobites from the Middle Ordovician Walcott–Rust Quarry in New York State, USA. Walcott–Rust trilobites reveal the intricate three-dimensional organization of the non-biomineralized ventral anatomy preserved as calcite casts, including the spatial relationship between the articulated sternites (i.e. ventral exoskeletal plates) and the wedge-shaped protopodites. Enrolment in trilobites is achieved by ventrally dipping the anterior margin of the sternites during trunk flexure, facilitated by the presence of flexible membranes, and with the close coupling of the wedge-shaped protopodites. Comparisons with the ventral morphology of extant glomerid millipedes and terrestrial isopods reveal similar mechanisms used for enrolment. The wedge-shaped protopodites of trilobites closely resemble the gnathobasic coxa/protopodite of extant horseshoe crabs. We propose that the trilobites' wedge-shaped protopodite simultaneously facilitated tight enrolment and gnathobasic feeding with the trunk appendages."

Almost all eukaryotic organisms, from plants and animals to fungi, can't survive without mitochondria -- the ""powerhouses of the cell,"" which generate chemical energy using oxygen. However, a new study by Lukáš Novák and Vladimír Hampl of Charles University, published in the journal PLOS Genetics, finds that multiple members of the oxymonads, a group of single-celled protists that live inside the guts of termites and other animals, have evolved to live quite happily without them.

Many groups of protists have evolved simplified mitochondria, but for a long time, scientists thought it was impossible for a species to completely lose them. The first eukaryotic organism discovered to live without mitochondria was an oxymonad isolated from the intestines of a chinchilla. In the new study, the research team looked to see if similar organisms had also shed them. They compared genomic data from the original oxymonad to multiple related species to see if they could decipher how the organisms evolved to live without this supposedly vital part of the cell.
The researchers showed that multiple oxymonads have gotten rid of their mitochondria -- possibly the entire lineage. This event likely would have occurred at least 100 million years ago, before the ancestor of the oxymonads diversified into multiple species. The findings also demonstrate that it's possible for eukaryotic organisms to thrive without mitochondria, and to evolve into the wide range of shapes and specialized structures seen in oxymonads living today.
The authors add: ""These microbes have been thriving without mitochondria since the age of dinosaurs.""

Yet, questions remain about whether this extends beyond the single species and how this transition took place. The Oxymonadida is a group of gut endobionts taxonomically housed in the Preaxostyla which also contains free-living flagellates of the genera Trimastix and Paratrimastix. The latter two taxa harbour conspicuous mitochondrion-related organelles (MROs). Here we report high-quality genome and transcriptome assemblies of two Preaxostyla representatives, the free-living Paratrimastix pyriformis and the oxymonad Blattamonas nauphoetae. We performed thorough comparisons among all available genomic and transcriptomic data of Preaxostyla to further decipher the evolutionary changes towards amitochondriality, endobiosis, and unstacked Golgi. Our results provide insights into the metabolic and endomembrane evolution, but most strikingly the data confirm the complete loss of mitochondria for all three oxymonad species investigated (M. exilis, B. nauphoetae, and Streblomastix strix), suggesting the amitochondriate status is common to a large part if not the whole group of Oxymonadida. This observation moves this unique loss to 100 MYA when oxymonad lineage diversified."

Ancient bricks inscribed with the names of Mesopotamian kings have yielded important insights into a mysterious anomaly in Earth's magnetic field 3,000 years ago, according to a new study involving UCL researchers.

The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), describes how changes in the Earth's magnetic field imprinted on iron oxide grains within ancient clay bricks, and how scientists were able to reconstruct these changes from the names of the kings inscribed on the bricks.
The team hopes that using this ""archaeomagnetism,"" which looks for signatures of the Earth's magnetic field in archaeological items, will improve the history of Earth's magnetic field, and can help better date artefacts that they previously couldn't.
Co-author Professor Mark Altaweel (UCL Institute of Archaeology) said: ""We often depend on dating methods such as radiocarbon dates to get a sense of chronology in ancient Mesopotamia. However, some of the most common cultural remains, such as bricks and ceramics, cannot typically be easily dated because they don't contain organic material. This work now helps create an important dating baseline that allows others to benefit from absolute dating using archaeomagnetism.""
The Earth's magnetic field weakens and strengthens over time, changes which imprint a distinct signature on hot minerals that are sensitive to the magnetic field. The team analysed the latent magnetic signature in grains of iron oxide minerals embedded in 32 clay bricks originating from archaeological sites throughout Mesopotamia, which now overlaps with modern day Iraq. The strength of the planet's magnetic field was imprinted upon the minerals when they were first fired by the brickmakers thousands of years ago.
At the time they were made, each brick was inscribed with the name of the reigning king which archaeologists have dated to a range of likely timespans. Together, the imprinted name and the measured magnetic strength of the iron oxide grains offered a historical map of the changes to the strength of the Earth's magnetic field.
The researchers were able to confirm the existence of the ""Levantine Iron Age geomagnetic Anomaly,"" a period when Earth's magnetic field was unusually strong around modern Iraq between about 1050 to 550 BCE for unclear reasons. Evidence of the anomaly has been detected as far away as China, Bulgaria and the Azores, but data from within the southern part of the Middle East itself had been sparse.

Lead author Professor Matthew Howland of Wichita State University said: ""By comparing ancient artefacts to what we know about ancient conditions of the magnetic field, we can estimate the dates of any artifacts that were heated up in ancient times.""
To measure the iron oxide grains, the team carefully chipped tiny fragments from broken faces of the bricks and used a magnetometer to precisely measure the fragments.
By mapping out the changes in Earth's magnetic field over time, this data also offers archaeologists a new tool to help date some ancient artefacts. The magnetic strength of iron oxide grains embedded within fired items can be measured and then matched up to the known strengths of Earth's historic magnetic field. The reigns of kings lasted from years to decades, which offers better resolution than radiocarbon dating which only pinpoints an artefact's date to within a few hundred years.
An additional benefit of the archaeomagnetic dating of the artefacts is it can help historians more precisely pinpoint the reigns of some of the ancient kings that have been somewhat ambiguous. Though the length and order of their reigns is well known, there has been disagreement within the archaeological community about the precise years they took the throne resulting from incomplete historical records. The researchers found that their technique lined up with an understanding of the kings' reigns known to archaeologists as the ""Low Chronology.""
The team also found that in five of their samples, taken during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II from 604 to 562 BCE, the Earth's magnetic field seemed to change dramatically over a relatively short period of time, adding evidence to the hypothesis that rapid spikes in intensity are possible.
Co-author Professor Lisa Tauxe of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (US) said: ""The geomagnetic field is one of the most enigmatic phenomena in earth sciences. The well-dated archaeological remains of the rich Mesopotamian cultures, especially bricks inscribed with names of specific kings, provide an unprecedented opportunity to study changes in the field strength in high time resolution, tracking changes that occurred over several decades or even less.""
The research was carried out with funding from the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation.

These data contribute to rectifying geographic disparities in the resolution of the global archaeointensity curve that have hampered our understanding of geomagnetic field dynamics and the viability of applying archaeomagnetism as a method of absolute dating of archaeological objects. A lack of precise and well-dated intensity data in the region has also limited our ability to identify short-term fluctuations in the geomagnetic field, such as the Levantine Iron Age geomagnetic Anomaly (LIAA), a period of high field intensity from ca. 1050 to 550 BCE. This phenomenon has hitherto not been well-demonstrated in Mesopotamia, contrary to predictions from regional geomagnetic models. To address these issues, this study presents precise archaeomagnetic results from 32 inscribed baked bricks, tightly dated to the reigns of 12 Mesopotamian kings through interpretation of their inscriptions. Results confirm the presence of the high field values of the LIAA in Mesopotamia during the first millennium BCE and drastically increase the resolution of the archaeointensity curve for the 3rd–1st millennia BCE. This research establishes a baseline for the use of archaeomagnetic analysis as an absolute dating technique for archaeological materials from Mesopotamia."

In their rapid characterization of the magnitude 6.8 Al Haouz earthquake in Morocco, researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) suggest that the earthquake ruptured roughly 25 kilometers deep beneath the surface.

The USGS source modeling, published in The Seismic Record, shows a compact source for the earthquake with slip occurring between 15 and 35 kilometers deep -- deeper than might be commonly expected for earthquakes in this region.
However, the 8 September earthquake took place in a region with very few historically recorded earthquakes. ""In the region there's not a high rate of seismic activity, so we don't have a great idea of what the 'common' characteristics are of large earthquakes in the Atlas Mountains,"" said U.S. Geological Survey seismologist William Yeck.
Seismologists use information about the depth of earthquake slip to help understand the seismic hazard in a particular region. The Al Haouz earthquake rupture did not break the surface and few aftershocks were recorded, both of which make it difficult to confirm which faults were involved in the earthquake, Yeck noted.
The earthquake is named after the Moroccan province most impacted by the shaking, with violent shaking near its epicenter and very strong shaking in the city of Marrakesh. Nearly 3,000 deaths and 5,500 injuries, along with widespread damage to structures, were reported in the weeks after the earthquake.
The USGS researchers relied on teleseismic data -- seismic wave data collected from stations around the globe -- for their analysis. The nearest seismic station is 100 kilometers away from the earthquake epicenter, and there are only three other stations within 500 kilometers with openly available data available in real time. The researchers combined the teleseismic data with InSAR satellite data, which captures changes in ground deformation, to create several models of the earthquake source.
""We use a lot of tools to characterize these earthquakes and each one gives us specific constraints,"" Yeck explained. ""Waveform modeling gives us the best estimate of the seismic centroid, the depth rupture, whereas InSAR can give us the precise location on the surface. It's really combining these data sets that gives us the most complete picture of the earthquake.""
The modeling shows that the earthquake occurred in the lower crust about 25 kilometers beneath the western Moroccan High Atlas Mountains and was a blind rupture, meaning it did not reach the surface.

""We have some sense of the[area's] large surface faults and some sense of how they dip and how they extend at depth, but their shape can change at depth, which makes it difficult to pin this to a fault on the surface,"" said Yeck.
Only five aftershocks were captured in the NEIC database. ""To understand the faulting in the region you want to have a good picture of the aftershocks, because then you can actually image which faults slipped,"" Yeck noted. ""But there can still be some ambiguity where slip occurred without those aftershocks.""
The researchers say that their study illustrates the benefits of regional and national networks following international data exchange standards to share real-time seismic data with the global seismic monitoring community, especially for earthquakes in remote regions with sparse seismic coverage.

Here, we present the rapid earthquake source products produced by the USGS NEIC, describing how the source model was derived using both seismic and geodetic observations. Our analysis indicates that the earthquake was the result of oblique-reverse faulting in the lower crust on either a steeply north-dipping fault or a moderately south-dipping fault. Finite-slip models using seismic and geodetic data reveal a compact source, with slip occurring at depths of 15–35 km. The causative fault is not apparent, because the rupture did not break the surface, and it is not possible to definitively attribute the earthquake to a known structure. The earthquake centroid depth of 25 km is noteworthy, because it shows slip extending beyond common estimates of seismogenic depth. This earthquake highlights that the seismogenic processes associated with mountain building in this wide plate boundary region are poorly understood."

Researchers from the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History led a new analysis that sheds light on the ancestry and genetics of woolly dogs, a now extinct breed of dog that was a fixture of Indigenous Coast Salish communities in the Pacific Northwest for millennia. Anthropologist Logan Kistler and evolutionary molecular biologist Audrey Lin analyzed genetic clues preserved in the pelt of ""Mutton,"" the only known woolly dog fleece in the world, to pinpoint the genes responsible for their highly sought-after woolly fur.

The study's findings, published today, Dec. 14, in the journal Science, include interviews contributed by several Coast Salish co-authors, including Elders, Knowledge Keepers and Master Weavers, who provided crucial context about the role woolly dogs played in Coast Salish society.
""Coast Salish traditional perspective was the entire context for understanding the study's findings,"" said Kistler, the museum's curator of archaeobotany and archaeogenomics.
Coast Salish tribal nations in Washington state and British Columbia bred and cared for woolly dogs for thousands of years. Prized for their thick undercoats, the dogs were sheared like sheep and often kept in pens or on islands to carefully manage their breeding and to care for the canines' health and vitality. Coast Salish weavers used the dogs' wool to craft blankets and other woven items that served a variety of ceremonial and spiritual purposes. Woolly dogs themselves possessed spiritual significance and were often treated as beloved family members. As emblems for many Coast Salish communities, woolly dogs adorned woven baskets and other art forms.
By the mid-19th century, this once thriving dog wool-weaving tradition was in decline. In the late 1850s, naturalist and ethnographer George Gibbs cared for a woolly dog named Mutton. When Mutton died in 1859, Gibbs sent his pelt to the nascent Smithsonian Institution, where the fleece has resided ever since. However, few were aware of the pelt's existence until it was rediscovered in the early 2000s.
Lin first learned about Mutton when she was a Peter Buck postdoctoral fellow at the museum in 2021.
""When I saw Mutton in person for the first time, I was just overcome with excitement,"" said Lin, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at the American Museum of Natural History. ""I had heard from some other people that he was a bit scraggly, but I thought he was gorgeous.""
She was surprised to find out that virtually no work had been done on the genetics of woolly dogs, which disappeared around the turn of the 20th century. She teamed up with Kistler and they reached out to several Coast Salish communities to gauge their interest in working together on a potential research project on woolly dogs.

Many in the Coast Salish communities were eager to share their knowledge.
""We were very excited to participate in a study that embraces the most sophisticated Western science with the most established Traditional Knowledge,"" said Michael Pavel, an Elder from the Skokomish/Twana Coast Salish community in Washington, who remembers hearing about woolly dogs early in his childhood. ""It was incredibly rewarding to contribute to this effort to embrace and celebrate our understanding of the woolly dog.""
To complement the perspectives they received from Pavel and other Coast Salish people from British Columbia and Washington state (the text from their interviews is available in the study's supplementary materials), Lin, Kistler and their colleagues began analyzing Mutton's genetic code. They sequenced the woolly dog genome and compared it with the genomes of ancient and modern breeds of dogs to determine what set woolly dogs apart. They also identified certain chemical signatures called isotopes in Mutton's pelt to determine the dog's diet and teamed up with noted natural history illustrator Karen Carr to create a life-like reconstruction of what Mutton looked like in the 1850s. Carr's work is the first in-depth reconstruction of a Coast Salish woolly dog in nearly three decades.
Based on the genetic data, the team estimated that woolly dogs diverged from other breeds up to 5,000 years ago -- a date that lines up with archaeological remains from the region. They also discovered that Mutton was genetically similar to pre-colonial dogs from Newfoundland and British Columbia. The researchers estimate that nearly 85% of Mutton's ancestry can be linked to pre-colonial dogs. This ancient ancestry is surprising because Mutton lived decades after the introduction of European dog breeds. This makes it likely that Coast Salish communities continued to maintain woolly dogs' unique genetic makeup until right before the dogs were wiped out.
In total, the team analyzed more than 11,000 different genes in Mutton's genome to determine what gave woolly dogs their fluffy fleece and wool fibers that could be spun together to create yarn. They identified 28 genes that have links to hair growth and follicle regeneration. These included a gene that causes a woolly hair phenotype in humans, and another linked to curly hair in other dogs. Similar genes were even activated in the genomes of woolly mammoths.
However, Mutton's genetics could tell the researchers little about what caused the dogs to decline. Traditionally, scholars have speculated that the arrival of machine-made blankets to the region in the early 19th century made woolly dogs expendable. But insights from Pavel and other traditional experts revealed that it was improbable that such a central part of Coast Salish society could be replaced.

Instead, woolly dogs were likely doomed by numerous factors impacting the Coast Salish tribal nations after European settlers arrived. Due to disease and colonial policies of cultural genocide, displacement and forced assimilation, it likely became increasingly difficult or forbidden for Coast Salish communities to maintain their woolly dogs.
""It was thousands of years of very careful maintenance lost within a couple of generations,"" Lin said.
But despite their disappearance, the memory of woolly dogs is still embedded into Coast Salish society. And Pavel thinks their understanding of woolly dogs is only getting clearer thanks to the new research effort.
""All of our communities held a certain aspect of knowledge about the woolly dog,"" Pavel said. ""But when woven together, as a result of participating in this study, we now have a much more complete understanding.""

A new Rice University study of the remains of prehistoric and modern African antelopes found that AI technology accurately identified animals more than 90% of the time compared to humans, who had much lower accuracy rates depending on the expert.

Identifying these animals and their habits helps paint a broader picture of ancient ecosystems, and with the assistance of this new technology, it can be done with more speed and accuracy than previously done by paleontologists, according to the study.
""African bovid tribe classification using transfer learning and computer vision"" appeared in a recent edition of Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. The study outlines the groundbreaking AI technology used to analyze prehistoric livestock remains.
So why does it matter how these ancient animals lived and what they ate? According to Manuel Domínguez-Rodrigo, visiting professor of anthropology at Rice, co-director of Madrid's Institute of Evolution in Africa and professor of prehistory at the University of Alcalá in Spain, the study sheds light on how the ecology of the time affected the evolution of mammal communities including humans, who over the past two million years have become highly dependent on other mammals.
""The evolution of ecosystems in Africa is of major relevance to understand what shaped our own evolution as humans,"" Domínguez-Rodrigo said. ""Our prehistoric ancestors were highly dependent on resources available in different habitats of African savanna ecosystems. Using fossil mammals -- highly specialized in their adaptations to different habitats -- to reconstruct these landscapes has been the most used method to interpret their ecology. Identifying those mammals by their teeth has not always been straightforward and was subjected to a high degree of expert knowledge and bias. Now we can do that with much more confidence. This will enable us to understand past environments but also understand better modern landscapes too when documenting the dead animals that they still contain.""
And thanks to this technology, whose application to paleobiology is pioneered in Domínguez-Rodrigo's lab, he says archaeologists can now analyze information far more quickly and accurately than before.
""These AI methods are a revolution for the studies of paleobiology and human evolution in particular,"" he said. ""They provide an objective, replicable way of identifying animals, including the degree of confidence with which identifications are made.""
Domínguez-Rodrigo said the success of AI in other fields, such as image-based medicine, was a proof of concept for its widespread application to other fields.
""Now paleontology and archaeology are experiencing a profound -- although still somewhat slow -- revolution by incorporating these techniques,"" he said. ""Not only can we now be more secure about identifying different types of African antelopes, but we are working already on doing things that archaeologists have been unable to do from screening landscapes as they were millions of years ago and discovering new sites, to identifying the specific carnivore types that were interacting with humans, to a better understanding on how fossils were modified by all of them. The consequences to reconstruct how evolution shaped humans cannot be overstated.""

Subjective interpretation of fossils and their modifications remains a nonreplicable expert endeavor. Identification of African bovids is a crucial element in the reconstruction of paleo‐landscapes, ungulate paleoecology, and, eventually, hominin adaptation and ecosystemic reconstruction. Recent analytical efforts drawing on Fourier functional analysis and discrimination methods applied to occlusal surfaces of teeth have provided a highly accurate framework to correctly classify African bovid tribes and taxa. Artificial intelligence tools, like computer vision, have also shown their potential to be objectively more accurate in the identification of taphonomic agency than human experts. For this reason, here we implement some of the most successful computer vision methods, using transfer learning and ensemble analysis, to classify bidimensional images of African bovid teeth and show that 92% of the large testing set of images of African bovid tribes analyzed could be correctly classified. This brings an objective tool to paleoecological interpretation, where bovid identification and paleoecological interpretation can be more confidently carried out."

Widespread caries and toothache -- but also some dental work and filing of front teeth. Viking Age teeth from Varnhem bear witness to surprisingly advanced dentistry. This has been shown in a study carried out at the University of Gothenburg.

The study examined 3,293 teeth from 171 individuals among the Viking Age population of Varnhem in Västergötland, Sweden. The site is known for extensive excavations of Viking and medieval environments, including tombs where skeletons and teeth have been preserved well in favorable soil conditions.
The research team from the University of Gothenburg's Institute of Odontology worked with an osteologist from Västergötland's Museum. The skulls and teeth were transported to Gothenburg, where all the examinations were carried out.
The teeth underwent clinical examinations using standard dentistry tools under bright light. A number of X-ray examinations were also performed using the same technique used in dentistry, where the patient bites down on a small square imaging plate in the mouth.
Caries and tooth loss
The results, which have been published in the journal PLOS ONE, show that 49% of the Viking population had one or more caries lesions. Of the adults' teeth, 13% were affected by caries -- often at the roots. However, children with milk teeth -- or with both milk and adult teeth -- were entirely caries-free.
Tooth loss was also common among adults. The studied adults had lost an average of 6% of their teeth, excluding wisdom teeth, over their lifetimes. The risk of tooth loss increased with age.

The findings suggest that caries, tooth infections, and toothache were common among the Viking population in Varnhem. However, the study also reveals examples of attempts to look after teeth in various ways.
""There were several signs that the Vikings had modified their teeth, including evidence of using toothpicks, filing front teeth, and even dental treatment of teeth with infections,"" says Carolina Bertilsson, a dentist and Associate Researcher, and the study's first-named and corresponding author.
Not unlike today's treatments
One sign of more sophisticated procedures was molars with filed holes, from the crown of the tooth and into the pulp, probably in order to relieve pressure and alleviate severe toothache due to infection.
""This is very exciting to see, and not unlike the dental treatments we carry out today when we drill into infected teeth. The Vikings seem to have had knowledge about teeth, but we don't know whether they did these procedures themselves or had help.""
The filed front teeth may have been a form of identity marker. In both this and previous studies, the cases found were male. Carolina Bertilsson continues:
""This study provides new insights into Viking oral health, and indicates that teeth were important in Varnhem's Viking culture. It also suggests that dentistry in the Viking Age was probably more sophisticated than previously thought.""

The dentitions were studied clinically, using a dental probe under a strong light source, and radiographs were taken for 18 of the individuals to verify and complement the clinical caries registration. Almost half the population, 83 of 171 individuals (49%), had at least one carious lesion. All individuals with deciduous or mixed dentitions were caries-free. The number of teeth affected by caries among adults was 424 (13%) and the surface most susceptible to caries was the root surface. The tooth most commonly affected by caries was the first mandibular molar. Other findings included apical infections, which were detected clinically in 4% of the teeth, and one case of filed front teeth. The findings gave a unique understanding of life and death in this early Christian Viking community and indicated that it was common to suffer from dental caries, tooth loss, infections of dental origin and tooth pain. These Vikings also manipulated their teeth through filing, tooth picking and other occupational behaviors."

The war in Ukraine is not just a war against a people, but a war on culture.

And after nearly two years of fighting, it is destroying Ukraine's cultural heritage on a scale not seen since World War II, according to new research by University of Notre Dame faculty members Ian Kuijt and William Donaruma.
Kuijt, a professor in the Department of Anthropology, and Donaruma, a professor of the practice in the Department of Film, Television and Theatre, visited Ukraine to see firsthand and begin to document the extent of the damage to cultural sites including churches, schools, opera houses, libraries and archaeological sites.
Working in collaboration with researchers from the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, the Institute of Archaeology at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the University of Wyoming, the team completed the first ground-based survey of the region since the invasion. Their findings were recently published in the journal Antiquity.
""The intent by the Russians is essentially obliterating Ukrainian culture, heritage and history,"" Kuijt said. ""They have been targeting cultural features of society that have no military capability, no hardened infrastructures that would be used in defense. And there are many researchers who have started doing work with satellite and aerial photos, but at some point, you have to go into the field to truly get a sense of the damage.""
Kuijt and Donaruma visited liberated areas in Ukraine to assess, film and document the destruction. Their interdisciplinary collaboration allowed Kuijt, an archaeologist, and Donaruma, a narrative and documentary filmmaker, to provide a more holistic view of the conditions in Ukraine's built environment.
Walking through the ruins, Kuijt said, revealed more widespread and far more extensive damage than the team anticipated. They also found that the devastation not only exists above ground from missile strikes, but also extends below the surface due to the widespread trench systems used by military forces.

The researchers mapped out the substantial damage incurred by churches and historic buildings from as early as the 11th and 12th centuries. Architectural monuments and UNESCO-listed heritage sites -- even those that have appeared fairly intact in satellite imagery -- have also suffered.
""Beyond the destruction and damage, particularly in populated, civilian areas, we were astonished to see the amount of preparation and defense of cultural heritage sites and objects,"" Donaruma said. ""Large sheets of metal covered stained-glass windows. Fortified cages covered statues, and museums were boxing artifacts for storage.""
For every church the researchers found in similar condition, Kuijt estimated there are three to four other archaeological sites below ground that are also impacted.
Despite modern military advancements such as satellites, drones and tanks, much of the war in Ukraine is reliant on trenches and bunkers -- which has resulted in digging and tunneling through the ground, often underneath or right up to the foundations of crucial heritage sites. This has likely destroyed thousands of archaeological spaces, according to Kuijt, including medieval cemeteries and Bronze Age settlements.
This first hit home for Kuijt and Donaruma when visiting a previously unknown graveyard near St. George Chapel in Oster. There, team members discovered that the trench system had exposed the foundations of the 11th-century church and portions of the cemetery associated with it.
Further explorations revealed that other burial mounds and cemetery sites in the region have been affected by both missile strikes and underground trench systems, including one of the largest 11th-century necropolises in Ukraine.

The region has played a key role throughout human history, Kuijt said, as a crossroads of ancient people, culture, religion, language and literature for thousands of years.
""Some of our best understanding of Paleolithic and Neolithic times was formed around the Black Sea,"" he said. ""This is where Bronze Age villagers created structures and villages that traded pottery with people from Turkey, Georgia and other places. Vikings moved through and traded in these areas. The emergence of specific forms of Christianity occurred here, along with the construction of its churches -- including ritual and religious life that is unique in this area. So, in many ways, this should be viewed as a global heritage.""
Because the war in Ukraine is ongoing, the researchers know that further destruction is likely, especially in the eastern and southern areas of the country where the most intense battles are currently happening. However, it is critical to begin assessing the damage now, even as it continues to occur, the researchers said.
""There is very much a ticking clock,"" Kuijt said. ""This is essentially cultural triage. We need to assess which antiquities are the most important and the least damaged, and how we can allocate resources to try to protect those as best we can.""
While they anticipate that it may be five to 10 years before archaeologists will be able to truly sort out how much damage has taken place, Kuijt and Donaruma are hopeful their work will help to begin documenting all that the Ukrainian people have lost -- and to prevent or minimize the ongoing devastation.
""Ian and I are both longing to return to Ukraine to continue our work with Ukrainian archeologists and students to keep the world apprised of the war and impact it has on lives and cultural heritage,"" Donaruma said. ""We have made so many friends in Ukraine in a short period of time that our passion to help and continue this work is of the utmost importance.""

The high-altitude hero of the Himalayas, yak are among the few large animals that can survive the extremely cold, harsh and oxygen-poor conditions of the Tibetan Plateau. In the mountainous regions of Asia, yak and yak-cattle hybrids serve as vital sources of meat, milk, transportation and fuel. However, little is known about their history: when or where yak were domesticated.

In a study published Dec. 13 in Science Advances, an international team of researchers that includes archaeologists at Washington University in St. Louis report archaeologically and genetically confirmed evidence for domestic yak, dating back 2,500 years, by far the oldest record.
The researchers zeroed in on this date using ancient DNA from a single male yak that lived alongside domestic cattle and yak-cattle hybrids in a settlement known as Bangga, a community in the southern Tibetan Plateau located at an elevation of approximately 3,750 meters (12,300 feet) above sea level.
""Many scholars have speculated that yak was first domesticated in the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau,"" said Xinyi Liu, an associate professor of archaeology in Arts & Sciences at Washington University. ""It was a well-informed speculation, but up to this point, there hasn't been robust evidence for that,"" Liu said. ""This is the first evidence supported by both archaeology and ancient DNA.""
From unknown origins
Once widespread in the Tibetan Plateau, wild yak are now listed as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with only an estimated 7,500 to 10,000 mature individuals left in the wild.
Domesticated yak, however, are prevalent across much of the world. An estimated 14 million to 15 million live in the highlands of Asia alone.

Scientists have previously traced the origins of other domestic bovine species found in Asia. This includes the taurine cattle found primarily in Europe and temperate areas of Asia; indicine cattle, or zebus, found primarily in India and tropical areas of Asia; and water buffalos in East and Southeast Asia. ""Yak remains an open inquiry,"" Liu said.
""Identifying domestic yak and yak-cattle hybrids at Bangga is not only essential to the understanding of the origin of this charismatic creature, the yak, but also informs us in general about animal domestication pathways, in which gene flow between related stocks is increasingly appreciated,"" he said.
A transdisciplinary approach
Bangga is one of the earliest agro-pastoral settlements in the southern Tibetan Plateau and the only site in the region with abundant animal remains to have been systematically excavated in recent decades. This work at Bangga, led by Hongliang Lu from Sichuan University, has provided scientists with a glimpse of daily lives at extremely high elevations between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago, contributing excellent momentum around improving our knowledge about the ancient Himalayan region.
The excavations at Bangga also offer a rare opportunity to explore the history of early yak, cattle and their hybrids. For this study, Liu and his fellow archaeologists paired up with livestock geneticists. The team used ancient DNA sequencing as well as zooarchaeological analysis and radiocarbon measurements to help answer questions that could not be resolved with field analysis alone. ""Our research at Bangga is a good example of the transdisciplinary and internationally collaborative nature of the 21st century archaeology,"" Liu said.
Starting with more than 10,000 pieces of mammal bones collected at Bangga, Zhengwei Zhang, an alumnus of Washington University who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Sichuan University, identified and sorted out 193 specimens belonging to the genus Bos, a group that includes all domestic cattle, zebus and yak, as well as their wild progenitors, aurochs.

The researchers subsequently selected five well-preserved bones from these Bos samples to sequence for whole-genomic ancestry. The sequencing work was led by Ningbo Chen and Chuzhao Lei, two leading geneticists at Northwest A&F University who specialized in Bos domestication.
Genetic analysis revealed that only one of the ancient bones came from a yak, a male individual, while the other four bones were from female taurine cattle. Even figuring out that the cattle were taurine cattle was a surprise, Liu said, as Bangga is located close to the Himalayas and within the range of zebus and Indian aurochs, which were not found at Bangga. Instead, the cattle belonged to the taurine lineage that was introduced to the region from Anatolia via the silk route and northern Tibetan Plateau.
Additional analysis helped clarify that the bone from the male yak was truly a domestic variant, and not just a bone from a wild yak that hunters had killed and brought back to the settlement as food. The researchers also saw evidence for hybridization between the two species.
Bringing yak home
This new discovery of domesticated yak from 2,500 years ago fits into the larger story that is beginning to emerge about how humans adapted to living in a high-altitude environment on the Tibetan Plateau. For example, Liu and his colleagues have previously documented how people in this region grew barley as they faced a challenging environment.
""Bangga provided us with a unique window into lifeways at high elevations 3,000 to 2,000 years ago,"" Liu said. ""They cultivated barley in an intensive way, provisioned sheep with fodder and water and consumed milk. All these resources were introduced to the Tibetan Plateau from other world regions as part of prehistoric food globalization and had become part of the Tibetan legacy. Now we know they had domestic yak.""
This discovery of the genetically confirmed evidence of domestic yak does not yet solve all questions about yak domestication, nor does it necessarily represent the very beginning of that domestication process. However, it hints at what motivated herders to bring yak home.
Early herders in this region were likely faced with harsh conditions, where animals died out quickly because of prolonged winters and severe snow storms. One would need to be innovative, living in such conditions. A possible solution is intensive corralling, which would have allowed herders to provision their herds with agricultural by-products and water year-round. This strategy is attested by recent zooarchaeological and isotopic work led by Liu and Zhang.
The other solution would be to combine the environmental hardiness of yak with the productivity of cattle. ""Dzomo (female hybrid) and dzo (male) are still the most common stocks in the Plateau even today for that reason. Cattle produce more milk and meat, but they are not as good at adapting to the high-altitude environment as yak,"" Liu said. ""Hybridization allows cattle to move high, and yak to move low at the same time they produce more milk.""
Study co-author Fiona Marshall, professor emerita of Washington University and a world-leading expert on animal domestication, said the study draws attention to the genetic continuity among domestic yak and taurine cattle on the Tibetan Plateau. In many regions of the world, early domesticated animals were replaced by later varieties. The genomic data suggests such faunal turnover did not happen on the Tibetan Plateau.
""This suggests a successful and long-lasting legacy of early Tibetan communities who were cosmopolitan in subsistence strategies and resilient and innovative in facing a challenging climate,"" Liu said. ""Bangga provides the best example of such a community.""

However, little is known about their history. Bos remains are uncommon in this region, and ancient domestic yak have not been securely identified. To identify Bos taxa and investigate their initial management, we conducted zooarchaeological analyses of 193 Bos specimens and sequenced five nuclear genomes from recently excavated assemblages at Bangga. Morphological data indicated that more cattle than yak were present. Ancient mitochondrial DNA and nuclear genome sequences identified taurine cattle and provided evidence for domestic yak and yak-cattle hybridization ~2500 years ago. Reliance on diverse Bos species and their hybrid has increased cattle adaptation and herder resilience to plateau conditions. Ancient cattle and yak at Bangga were closely related to contemporary livestock, indicating early herder legacies and the continuity of cattle and yak husbandry on the Tibetan Plateau."

Karthik Shekhar and his colleagues raised a few eyebrows as they collected cow and pig eyes from Boston butchers, but those eyes -- eventually from 17 separate species, including humans -- are providing insights into the evolution of the vertebrate retina and could lead to better animal models for human eye diseases.

The retina is a miniature computer containing diverse types of cells that collectively process visual information before transmitting it to the rest of the brain. In a comparative analysis across animals of the many cell types in the retina -- mice alone have 130 types of cells in the retina, as Shekhar's previous studies have shown -- the researchers concluded that most cell types have an ancient evolutionary history. These cell types, distinguished by their differences at the molecular level, give clues to their functions and how they participate in building our visual world.
Their remarkable conservation across species suggests that the retina of the last common ancestor of all mammals, which roamed the earth some 200 million year ago, must have had a complexity rivaling the retina of modern mammals. In fact, there are clear hints that some of these cell types can be traced back more than 400 million years ago to the common ancestors of all vertebrates -- that is, mammals, reptiles, birds and jawed fish.
The results will be published Dec. 13 in the journal Nature as part of a 10-paper package reporting the latest results of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network's efforts to create a cell-type atlas of the adult mouse brain. The first author is Joshua Hahn, a chemical and biomolecular engineering graduate student in Shekhar's group at the University of California, Berkeley. The work was an equal collaboration with the group of Joshua Sanes at Harvard University.
The findings were a surprise, since vertebrate vision varies so widely from species to species. Fish need to see underwater, mice and cats require good night vision, monkeys and humans evolved very sharp daytime eyesight for hunting and foraging. Some animals see vivid colors, while others are content with seeing the world in black and white.
Yet, numerous cell types are shared across a range of vertebrate species, suggesting that the gene expression programs that define these types likely trace back to the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates, the researchers concluded.
The team found, for example, that one cell type -- the ""midget"" retinal ganglion cell -- that is responsible for our ability to see fine detail, is not unique to primates, as it was thought to be. By analyzing large-scale gene expression data using statistical inference approaches, the researchers discovered evolutionary counterparts of midget cells in all other mammals, though these counterparts occurred in much smaller proportions.

""What we are seeing is that something thought to be unique to primates is clearly not unique. It's a remodeled version of a cell type that is probably very ancient,"" said Shekhar, a UC Berkeley assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering. ""The early vertebrate retina was probably extremely sophisticated, but the parts list has been used, expanded, repurposed or refurbished in all the species that have descended since then.""
Coincidentally, one of Shekhar's UC Berkeley colleagues, Teresa Puthussery of the School of Optometry, reported last month in Nature that another cell type thought to have been lost in the human eye -- a type of retinal ganglion cell responsible for gaze stabilization -- is still there. Puthussery and her colleagues used information from a previous paper co-authored by Shekhar to select molecular markers that helped identify this cell type in primate retinal tissue samples.
The discoveries are, in a sense, not a total surprise, since the eyes of vertebrates have a similar plan: Light is detected by photoreceptors, which relay the signal to bipolar, horizontal and amacrine cells, which in turn connect with retinal ganglion cells, which then relay the results to the brain's visual cortex. Shekhar uses new technologies, in particular single-cell genomics, to assay the molecular composition of thousands to tens of thousands of neurons at once within the visual system, from the retina to the visual cortex.
Because the number of identified retinal cell types varies widely in vertebrates -- about 70 in humans, but 130 in mice, based on previous studies by Shekhar and his colleagues -- the origins of these diverse cell types were a mystery.
One possibility that emerged from the new research, Shekhar said, is that as the primate brain became more complex, primates began to rely less on signal processing within the eye -- which is key to reflexive actions, such as reacting to an approaching predator -- and more on analysis within the visual cortex. Hence the apparent decrease in molecularly distinct cell types in the human eye.
""Our study is saying that the human retina may have evolved to trade cell types that perform sophisticated visual computations for cell types that basically just transmit a relatively unprocessed image of the visual world with the brain so that we can do a lot more sophisticated things with that,"" Shekhar said. ""We are giving up speed for finesse.""
The team's new detailed map of cell types in a variety of vertebrate retinas could aid research on human eye disease. Shekhar's group is also studying molecular hallmarks of glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and, in the U.S., the second most common cause of blindness after macular degeneration.

Yet, while mice are a favorite model animal for studying glaucoma, they have very few of the midget retinal ganglion cell counterparts. These cell types make up only 2% to 4% of all ganglion cells in mice, whereas 90% of retinal ganglion cells are midget cells in humans.
""This work is clinically important because, ultimately, the midget cells are probably what we should care about the most in human glaucoma,"" Shekhar said. ""Knowing their counterparts in the mouse will hopefully help us design and interpret these glaucoma mouse models a little better.""
Single-cell transcriptomics
Shekhar and Sanes have, for the past eight years, been applying single-cell genomic approaches to profile the mRNA molecules in cells to categorize them according to their gene expression fingerprints. That technique has gradually helped identify more and more distinct cell types within the retina, many of them through studies that Shekhar initiated while a postdoctoral fellow with Aviv Regev, one of the pioneers of single-cell genomics, at the Broad Institute. It was in her lab that Shekhar began working with Sanes, a  retinal neurobiologist who became Shekhar's co-advisor and collaborator.
In the current study, they wanted to expand their single-cell transcriptomic approach to other species to understand how retinal cell types have changed through evolution. They gathered, in all, eyes from 17 species: human, two monkeys (macaque and marmoset), four rodents (three species of mice and one ground squirrel), three ungulates (cow, sheep and pig), tree shrew, opossum, ferret, chicken, lizard, zebrafish and lamprey.
With Sanes' team at Harvard conducting the transcriptomic experiments and Shekhar's team at UC Berkeley conducting the computational analysis, many new cell types were identified in each of the species. They then mapped this variety to a smaller set of ""orthotypes"" -- cell types that have likely descended from the same ancestral cell type in early vertebrates.
For bipolar cells, which are a class of neurons that lie between the photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells, they found 14 distinct orthotypes. Most extant species contain 13 to 16 bipolar types, suggesting that these types have evolved little. In contrast, they found 21 orthotypes of retinal ganglion cells, which exhibit greater variation among species. Studies thus far have identified more than 40 distinct types in mice and about 20 different types in humans.
Interestingly, the pronounced evolutionary divergence among types of retinal ganglion cells, as compared to other retinal classes, suggests that natural selection acts more strongly on diversifying neuron types that transmit information from the retina to the rest of the brain.
They also found that numerous transcription factors, which have been implicated in retinal cell type specification in mice, are highly conserved, suggesting that the molecular steps leading to the development of the retina might be evolutionarily conserved, as well.
Based on the new work, Shekhar is refocusing his glaucoma research on the analogs of midget cells, called alpha cells, in mice.

Retinal cell types may have evolved to accommodate these varied needs, but this has not been systematically studied. Here we generated and integrated single-cell transcriptomic atlases of the retina from 17 species: humans, two non-human primates, four rodents, three ungulates, opossum, ferret, tree shrew, a bird, a reptile, a teleost fish and a lamprey. We found high molecular conservation of the six retinal cell classes (photoreceptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and Müller glia), with transcriptomic variation across species related to evolutionary distance. Major subclasses were also conserved, whereas variation among cell types within classes or subclasses was more pronounced. However, an integrative analysis revealed that numerous cell types are shared across species, based on conserved gene expression programmes that are likely to trace back to an early ancestral vertebrate. The degree of variation among cell types increased from the outer retina (photoreceptors) to the inner retina (RGCs), suggesting that evolution acts preferentially to shape the retinal output. Finally, we identified rodent orthologues of midget RGCs, which comprise more than 80% of RGCs in the human retina, subserve high-acuity vision, and were previously believed to be restricted to primates2. By contrast, the mouse orthologues have large receptive fields and comprise around 2% of mouse RGCs. Projections of both primate and mouse orthologous types are overrepresented in the thalamus, which supplies the primary visual cortex. We suggest that midget RGCs are not primate innovations, but are descendants of evolutionarily ancient types that decreased in size and increased in number as primates evolved, thereby facilitating high visual acuity and increased cortical processing of visual information."

At the end of the last ice age, large herds of bison roamed across Europe. But by 1927, the European bison became extinct in the wild, with only about 60 individuals remaining in captivity. Scientists have long debated the exact causes of the grazers' near extinction, and how much humans were to blame.

A new study combines fossil evidence, ancient DNA, and modeling to disentangle the threats that forced the European bison's population decline. Rapid environmental change and hunting by humans were the main drivers, according to the study, published today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.
Since the near-extinction of the European bison, enormous conservation efforts have helped to restore wild populations, and its numbers are on the rise. However, the study authors argue that ensuring the species's long-term protection and recovery requires understanding why they nearly went extinct in the first place.
""Our study also suggests areas where rewilding attempts are most likely to be successful,"" said lead author July Pilowsky, currently a disease ecologist at Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. Pilowsky completed the research while working on their PhD at University of Adelaide and University of Copenhagen.
Reconstructing the bison's decline
""This study is one of the few attempts to reconstruct the process of species extinction,"" explained co-author Rafał Kowalczyk, who heads the Mammal Research Institute at the Polish Academy of Sciences. ""It is a fascinating story of a species that is the last remnant of the legendary megafauna that inhabited the European continent in the late Pleistocene, and a lesson in how easy it is to wipe out a species.""
To clarify which factors led to the European bison's decline, Pilowsky and colleagues built a detailed simulation that combined paleoclimate data, vegetation and habitat information, the population growth and expansion of Palaeolithic humans across Eurasia, and bison population and dispersal dynamics. Historical records, fossil evidence, and ancient DNA were used to independently test the model's accuracy.

Researchers ran 55,000 different simulations to explore how climate, hunting by humans, and land use change affected bison population and distribution across Europe. Toggling off different variables one at a time allowed the scientists to test the importance of each variable. If human removal of forests was turned down to zero, for example, and there was no change in bison abundance and range, then the scientists would conclude that land use change likely was not a factor in the species' demise.
After reconstructing 21,000 years of European bison range dynamics, the team concluded that the bison's range began collapsing around 14,700 years ago due to rapid warming of the climate and its effects on bison habitat. After that, the activities of a growing number of humans prevented the bison from bouncing back. Hunting caused range loss in the north and east of its distribution, while land use change was responsible for losses in the west and south. The arrival of firearms in the 1500s dramatically hastened the species's decline.
""The stories of the past are being repeated in the present,"" said Kowalczyk. Land use change, poaching, and climate change are the very same threats that imperil the European bison today. ""Learning from the past, and understanding the process of species extinction, can help us better protect the species.""
Maximizing conservation efforts
The European bison is a priority species for conservation because it serves an important role as an ecosystem engineer, restoring grassland habitat. Thanks to efforts to reestablish and rewild the species, there are approximately 7,300 free-ranging European bison today. However, rewilding has been done without a strong understanding of habitats and regions where bison once thrived. As a result, the species has been released at sites ranging from the coastal dunes of the Netherlands to the mountains of the French Alps and the Mediterranean climate of Spain, with mixed success. Of the 47 free-living European bison populations, only eight have more than 150 adults, and all eight depend on supplemental feeding due to poor habitat suitability.
By identifying areas where the European bison would be distributed today if hunting and land use change had not occurred, the study zeroes in on regions that are most suitable for the species's reintroduction. These include parts of Poland, Ukraine, and western Russia.

With habitat restoration, parts of the Balkans and Germany also have the potential to be good sites for bison reintroduction.
""I hope that the maps we've produced can help inform future efforts in terms of where reintroduction efforts should occur,"" said Pilowsky. ""It's especially crucial because of the war in Ukraine. Over 50 percent of all free-living bison are in Ukraine, and conservationists are really worried.""
Next steps
Pilowsky next hopes to adjust the simulations to identify sites that are not only suitable for European bison today, but also in the future under human-caused climate and environmental change.
The study's methodology could also be adapted to reconstruct the causes of population declines and range collapses of other large herbivores, including American bison, to improve awareness of past threats and enrich current conservation plans.
Lessons learned are informing new lines of inquiry for Pilowsky. At Cary Institute, they are translating the bison simulation code into new software that models disease transmission in wildlife. ""I literally have my bison code open on one monitor and my new code that I'm building on another monitor,"" they said. Instead of simulating bison abundance and range, the new software shows the prevalence and distribution of a disease in a species over time.

However, the contributions of environmental change and humans to their near extinction have never been resolved. Using process-explicit models, fossils and ancient DNA, we disentangle the combinations of threatening processes that drove population declines and regional extinctions of European bison through space and across time. We show that the population size of European bison declined abruptly at the termination of the Pleistocene in response to rapid environmental change, hunting by humans and their interaction. Human activities prevented populations of European bison from rebounding in the Holocene, despite improved environmental conditions. Hunting caused range loss in the north and east of its distribution, while land use change was responsible for losses in the west and south. Advances in hunting technologies from 1500 CE were needed to simulate low abundances observed in 1870 CE. While our findings show that humans were an important driver of the extinction of the European bison in the wild, vast areas of its range vanished during the Pleistocene–Holocene transition because of post-glacial environmental change. These areas of its former range have been climatically unsuitable for millennia and should not be considered in reintroduction efforts."

In April 2015, looters sacked an ancient cave burial at a site called Urd Ulaan Uneet high within the Altai Mountains of western Mongolia. When police apprehended the criminals, they uncovered, among other artifacts, an elegantly carved saddle made from several pieces of birch wood.

Now, in a new study, researchers from Mongolia collaborating with University of Colorado Boulder archaeologist William Taylor have described the find. The team's radiocarbon dating pins the artifact to roughly the 4th Century C.E., making it one of the earliest known frame saddles in the world.
""It was a watershed moment in the technological history of people and horses,"" said Taylor, corresponding author of the new study and curator of archaeology at the CU Museum of Natural History.
He and his colleagues, including scientists from 10 countries, published their findings Dec. 12 in the journal Antiquity.
The research reveals the underappreciated role that ancient Mongolians played in the spread of horse riding technology and culture around the globe. Those advances ushered in a new and sometimes brutal era of mounted warfare around the same time as the fall of the Roman Empire.
The discovery also highlights the deep relationships between human and animals in Mongolia. For millennia, pastoral peoples have traveled between the vast grasslands of the Mongolian Steppe with their horses -- which, in the region, tend to be short but sturdy, capable of surviving winter temperatures that can plummet far below freezing. Airag, a lightly alcoholic beverage made from fermented horse milk, remains a popular libation in Mongolia.
""Ultimately, technology emerging from Mongolia has, through a domino effect, ended up shaping the horse culture that we have in America today, especially our traditions of saddlery and stirrups,"" Taylor said.

But these insights also come at a time when Mongolia's horse culture is beginning to disappear, said study lead author Jamsranjav Bayarsaikhan.
""Horses have not only influenced the history of the region but also left a deep mark on the art and worldview of the Nomadic Mongols,"" said Bayarsaikhan, an archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany. ""However, the age of technology is slowly erasing the culture and use of horses. Instead of herders riding horses, more and more people are riding motorcycles in the plains of Mongolia.""
Mounted combat
Bayarsaikhan was working as a curator at the National Museum of Mongolia when he and his colleagues got the call from police in Hovd Province. The team later excavated the Urd Ulaan Uneet cave and unearthed the mummified remains of a horse, which the group partially described in a 2018 paper.
The saddle itself was made from about six pieces of birch wood held together with wooden nails. It bears traces of red paint with black trim and includes two leather straps that likely once supported stirrups. (The researchers also reported an iron stirrup recently discovered from around the same time period in eastern Mongolia).
The group couldn't definitively trace back where those materials came from. Birch trees, however, grow commonly in the Mongolian Altai, suggesting that locals had crafted the saddle themselves, not traded for it.

Taylor explained that humans had used pads, a form of proto-saddle, to keep their rear ends comfortable on horseback since the earliest days of mounted riding. Rigid wooden saddles, which were much sturdier, paired with stirrups opened a new range of things that people could do with horses.
""One thing they very gave rise to was heavy cavalry and high-impact combat on horseback,"" Taylor said. ""Think of jousting in Medieval Europe.""
Traveling west
In the centuries after the Mongolian saddle was crafted, these types of tools spread rapidly west across Asia and into the early Islamic world. There, cavalry forces became key to conquest and trade across large portions of the Mediterranean region and northern Africa.
Where it all began, however, is less clear. Archaeologists have typically considered modern-day China the birthplace of the first frame saddles and stirrups -- with some finds dating back to the 5th to 6th Century C.E. or even earlier.
The new study, however, complicates that picture, Taylor said.
""It's not the only piece of information suggesting that Mongolia might have been either among the very first adopters of these new technologies -- or could, in fact, be the place where they were first innovated,"" he said.
He suspects that Mongolia's place in that history may have gone underappreciated for so long in part because of the region's geography. The population density in the country's mountainous expanses is low, among the lowest on Earth, making it difficult to encounter and analyze important archaeological finds.
Bayarsaikhan, for his part, calls for more archaeological research in the nation to better tell the story of horses in Mongolia.
""Mongolia is one of the few nations that has preserved horse culture from ancient times to the present day,"" he said. ""But the scientific understanding of the origin of this culture is still incomplete.""

Together, these finds suggest that Mongolian groups were early adopters of stirrups and saddles, facilitating the expansion of nomadic hegemony across Eurasia and shaping the conduct of medieval mounted warfare."

Horses have developed long faces simply 'because they can,' a team of evolutionary biologists say.

In a major review of how mammalian heads evolve, scientists from Flinders University and The University of Adelaide found that adaptations to feeding explain why large species of mammals often have much longer faces compared to smaller closely related species -- a pattern referred to as Craniofacial Evolutionary Allometry (CREA).
Study leader Dr Rex Mitchell, from Flinders University, says: ""The CREA pattern is seen across lots of different mammals that otherwise have little in common -- from cats to mice, from antelopes to baboons, from deer to kangaroos. However, so far, scientists have not been able to explain what causes it.""
Senior author Associate Professor Vera Weisbecker, also from the College of Science and Engineering at Flinders University, adds: ""Confusingly, there are also many mammals where the rule does not hold up or is even reversed.
""Australian carnivorous marsupials are a great example. We found that their largest living member, the Tasmanian devil, has an exceptionally short face compared to other species.""
Co-author Dr Emma Sherratt, from The University of Adelaide, says that the team went back to basic 'lever mechanics' to explain both the rule of the long face and its exceptions.
""Closely related mammals tend to eat similar foods. For example, different kangaroos species all eat grass or leaves and different species of wolves and foxes all eat meat. However, bigger animals of a group have a naturally stronger bite because their skull, teeth and jaw muscles are simply bigger.""
This means that smaller mammals need stronger bites to chew the same food as larger relatives. For this, shorter faces are advantageous because they can impart more bite force.

""When you grab barbecue tongs closer to their tips for a stronger grip, you are shortening the distance between the 'biting' end of the tongs and the squeeze of your hands. For exactly this reason, shorter faces also have stronger bites,"" explains Dr Mitchell.
""On the flip side, the naturally stronger bite that comes with being bigger means that large mammals do not need a short face to feed successfully,"" he says.
Instead, larger species' skulls can adapt when longer faces are an advantage. For example, long-snouted kangaroos or deer can reach further into trees and hold bigger mouthfuls of food. Longer jaws can close faster and allow predators like foxes and jackals to snatch small prey more easily.
Because of this, the team argue, large mammals such as horses have long faces just 'because they can'.
But what about those glaring exceptions?
""Our analyses of 22 mammal families show that there is almost always a radical change in diet when smaller mammals have longer faces than their larger relatives,"" adds Associate Professor Weisbecker.

""For example, Tasmanian devils are known to crush bones, and the short-snouted orcas feed on much larger prey than their fish-eating dolphin relatives. These behaviours need higher bite forces.
""But this also works the other way around. For example, the tiny honey possum has a much longer snout than would be expected for any possum, but it also mostly licks nectar from deep inside flowers and does not need to bite hard.""
All three team members agree that humans are probably an exception among exceptions.
""Humans do not use their snouts as a primary means of obtaining food. They use their hands and tools to manipulate can soften their food through cooking,"" Dr Mitchel says.
""This means that the evolution of the human face is probably more influenced by other things than their ability to bite.""

One widely retrieved pattern accompanying mammalian cranial diversification is referred to as ‘craniofacial evolutionary allometry’ (CREA). This posits that adults of larger species, in a group of closely related mammals, tend to have relatively longer faces and smaller braincases. However, no process has been officially suggested to explain this pattern, there are many apparent exceptions, and its predictions potentially conflict with well‐established biomechanical principles. Understanding the mechanisms behind CREA and causes for deviations from the pattern therefore has tremendous potential to explain allometry and diversification of the mammalian cranium. Here, we propose an amended framework to characterise the CREA pattern more clearly, in that ‘longer faces’ can arise through several kinds of evolutionary change, including elongation of the rostrum, retraction of the jaw muscles, or a more narrow or shallow skull, which all result in a generalised gracilisation of the facial skeleton with increased size. We define a standardised workflow to test for the presence of the pattern, using allometric shape predictions derived from geometric morphometrics analysis, and apply this to 22 mammalian families including marsupials, rabbits, rodents, bats, carnivores, antelopes, and whales. Our results show that increasing facial gracility with size is common, but not necessarily as ubiquitous as previously suggested. To address the mechanistic basis for this variation, we then review cranial adaptations for harder biting. These dictate that a more gracile cranium in larger species must represent a structural sacrifice in the ability to produce or withstand harder bites, relative to size. This leads us to propose that facial gracilisation in larger species is often a product of bite force allometry and phylogenetic niche conservatism, where more closely related species tend to exhibit more similar feeding ecology and biting behaviours and, therefore, absolute (size‐independent) bite force requirements. Since larger species can produce the same absolute bite forces as smaller species with less effort, we propose that relaxed bite force demands can permit facial gracility in response to bone optimisation and alternative selection pressures. Thus, mammalian facial scaling represents an adaptive by‐product of the shifting importance of selective pressures occurring with increased size. A reverse pattern of facial ‘shortening’ can accordingly also be found, and is retrieved in several cases here, where larger species incorporate novel feeding behaviours involving greater bite forces. We discuss multiple exceptions to a bite force‐mediated influence on facial proportions across mammals which lead us to argue that ecomorphological specialisation of the cranium is likely to be the primary driver of facial scaling patterns, with some developmental constraints as possible secondary factors. A potential for larger species to have a wider range of cranial functions when less constrained by bite force demands might also explain why selection for larger sizes seems to be prevalent in some mammalian clades. The interplay between adaptation and constraint across size ranges thus presents an interesting consideration for a mechanistically grounded investigation of mammalian cranial allometry."

When it comes to greenhouse gases, methane is one the biggest contributors. Not only is it massively abundant -- it's about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.

That makes tracking methane emissions critically important, and nowhere more so than in the Arctic, which is now the fastest warming part of the globe. A new study conducted at Brown University helps shed light on the actual atmospheric methane emissions from Arctic lakes and wetlands, which are major producers of the gas but remain largely unmapped.
Using unprecedented high-resolution satellite and airborne imagery from NASA -- harnessing the technology to overcome barriers posed by the region's sheer size and numerous natural land formations that are major methane producers -- a pair of researchers produced new estimates and found that these unmapped lakes are not the great methane emitters that previous research has made them out to be. Instead of contributing about 40% of the region's methane emissions, small unmapped lakes contribute only about 3%, according to the study.
""What the research has shown is that these smaller lakes are the greater emitters of methane on a per area basis, which means even that though they take up a small amount of the landscape they have a disproportionate level of emissions,"" said Ethan D. Kyzivat, who led the study as part of his Ph.D. at Brown. ""Traditionally, we haven't had a good picture of how much area they take up, but this new high-resolution dataset helped us scale it up to finally make those estimations much more accurately.""
These new findings, described in Geophysical Research Letters, contradict close to 15 years of research based on older datasets with much lower resolution quality. In the older data, the number of small lakes that could be seen were statistically extrapolated to produce estimates for the region on the total number of small unmapped lakes and how much methane they emitted.
The new analysis of the aerial imagery showed the researchers, including Brown professor Laurence C. Smith, that there are far fewer small, unmapped lakes than were previously estimated, greatly reducing the cumulative amount of methane they were thought to emit.
The study focuses on small lakes that are about a tenth of a square kilometer or smaller, which is equivalent to about 20 football fields. Kyzivat, who's now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University, spent more than two years working on the study, initially compiling the data while working on his master's degree and analyzing and writing the paper while working on his Ph.D. at Brown.

The project started as an effort to look for hidden lakes in the Arctic but morphed as the researchers examined the data more closely. The effort, which involved combining the high-resolution airborne data with a global map of lakes in the Arctic region, also unearthed a couple of unexpected but welcome results.
The work, for instance, shows that a lot of small and large lakes are still being double-counted as wetlands. This double-counting pumps methane emission estimates for the region, but taken with the new findings of fewer unmapped small lakes, the researchers believe the problem is on a smaller magnitude than what was previously thought.
Another unexpected result comes in methodology.
In the methane modeling field, there are two widely held trains of thought. One is ""bottom up"" estimates, which model methane emissions based on maps of the Earth, as the researchers do here. The other method is ""top down"" estimates, which model methane based on atmospheric measurements. For more than a decade, there has been a perplexing discrepancy between the figures produced by these two methods, according to Smith.
The new figures from the analysis may help reconcile the two opposing viewpoints by closing the difference between them.
""It's probably been 15 to 20 years of loggerheads, but the takeaway is the satellite resolution is now there for the 'bottom-up' community to take a much better look at how much methane is actually being emitted,"" said Smith, who is a professor of environmental studies and of earth, environmental and planetary sciences. ""We can now actually see the very smallest of these water bodies and they're not as abundant as we were extrapolating. The end result of all of this is going to reduce the bottom-up estimates to make them fall more in line with the top-down estimates. It's going to unify these two communities.""
Because of this, Kyzivat and Smith see the work from the NASA-funded study as a proof of concept and now look to expand their methane modeling technique to other parts of the world.
""The next step is to go global,"" Kyzivat said.

There is also growing awareness of the importance of lake aquatic vegetation and potential “double‐counting” with wetlands, but lack of consensus on which is most impactful. Here, we combine high‐resolution data with the comprehensive lake inventory HydroLAKES to rank these three variables based on emissions sensitivity. Including non‐inventoried small lakes <0.1 km2 (+30 [range: 9.0 to 82]% change) is greatest, followed by double‐counting (−20 [−11 to −34]%) and lake aquatic vegetation (+14 [2.7 to 43]%). Significantly, emissions from non‐inventoried lakes contribute far less than the ∼40% previously determined globally through statistical area extrapolation. We produce a first pan‐Arctic estimate of lake aquatic vegetation in 1.37 million km2 of lakes, but after correcting for persistent double‐counting, its net effect is to decrease emissions estimates by 9%. Thus, previous global emissions estimates are likely too high."

Paleontologists are getting a glimpse at life over a billion years in the past based on chemical traces in ancient rocks and the genetics of living animals. Research published Dec. 1 in Nature Communications combines geology and genetics, showing how changes in the early Earth prompted a shift in how animals eat.

David Gold, associate professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California, Davis, works in the new field of molecular paleontology, using the tools of both geology and biology to study the evolution of life. With new technology, it's possible to recover chemical traces of life from ancient rocks, where animal fossils are scarce.
Lipids in particular can survive in rocks for hundreds of millions of years. Traces of sterol lipids, which come from cell membranes, have been found in rocks up to 1.6 billion years old. In the present day, most animals use cholesterol -- sterols with 27 carbon atoms (C27) -- in their cell membranes. In contrast, fungi typically use C28 sterols, while plants and green algae produce C29 sterols. The C28 and C29 sterols are also known as phytosterols.
C27 sterols have been found in rocks 850 million years old, while C28 and C29 traces appear about 200 million years later. This is thought to reflect the increasing diversity of life at this time and the evolution of the first fungi and green algae.
Without actual fossils, it's hard to say much about the animals or plants these sterols came from. But a genetic analysis by Gold and colleagues is shedding some light.
Don't make it, eat it
Most animals are not able to make phytosterols themselves, but they can obtain them by eating plants or fungi. Recently, it was discovered that annelids (segmented worms, a group that includes the common earthworm) have a gene called smt, which is required to make longer-chain sterols. By looking at smt genes from different animals, Gold and colleagues created a family tree for smt first within the annelids, then across animal life in general.
They found that the gene originated very far back in the evolution of the first animals, and then went through rapid changes around the same time that phytosterols appeared in the rock record. Subsequently, most lineages of animals lost the smt gene.
""Our interpretation is that these phytosterol molecular fossils record the rise of algae in ancient oceans, and that animals abandoned phytosterol production when they could easily obtain it from this increasingly abundant food source,"" Gold said. ""If we're right, then the history of the smt gene chronicles a change in animal feeding strategies early in their evolution.""

Scientists hypothesize that ancient C27 steranes originated from cholesterol, the major sterol produced by living red algae and animals. Similarly, C28 and C29 steranes are thought to be derived from the sterols of prehistoric fungi, green algae, and other microbial eukaryotes. However, recent work on annelid worms–an advanced group of eumetazoan animals–shows that they are also capable of producing C28 and C29 sterols. In this paper, we explore the evolutionary history of the 24-C sterol methyltransferase (smt) gene in animals, which is required to make C28+ sterols. We find evidence that the smt gene was vertically inherited through animals, suggesting early eumetazoans were capable of C28+ sterol synthesis. Our molecular clock of the animal smt gene demonstrates that its diversification coincides with the rise of C28 and C29 steranes in the Neoproterozoic. This study supports the hypothesis that early eumetazoans were capable of making C28+ sterols and that many animal lineages independently abandoned its biosynthesis around the end-Neoproterozoic, coinciding with the rise of abundant eukaryotic prey."

Today atmospheric carbon dioxide is at its highest level in at least several million years thanks to widespread combustion of fossil fuels by humans over the past couple centuries.

But where does 419 parts per million (ppm) -- the current concentration of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere -- fit in Earth's history?
That's a question an international community of scientists, featuring key contributions by University of Utah geologists, is sorting out by examining a plethora of markers in the geologic record that offer clues about the contents of ancient atmospheres. Their initial study was published this week in the journal Science, reconstructing CO2 concentrations going back through the Cenozoic, the era that began with the demise dinosaurs and rise of mammals 66 million years ago.
Glaciers contain air bubbles, providing scientists direct evidence of CO2 levels going back 800,000 years, according to U geology professor Gabe Bowen, one of the study's corresponding authors. But this record does not extend very deep into the geological past.
""Once you lose the ice cores, you lose direct evidence. You no longer have samples of atmospheric gas that you can analyze,"" Bowen said. ""So you have to rely on indirect evidence, what we call proxies. And those proxies are tough to work with because they are indirect.""
""Proxies"" in the geologic record
These proxies include isotopes in minerals, the morphology of fossilized leaves and other lines of geological evidence that reflect atmospheric chemistry. One of the proxies stems from the foundational discoveries of U geologist Thure Cerling, himself a co-author on the new study, whose past research determined carbon isotopes in ancient soils are indicative of past CO2 levels.

But the strength of these proxies vary and most cover narrow slices of the past. The research team, called the Cenozoic CO2 Proxy Integration Project, or CenCO2PIP, and organized by Columbia University climate scientist Bärbel Hönisch, set out to evaluate, categorize and integrate available proxies to create a high-fidelity record of atmospheric CO2.
""This represents some of the most inclusive and statistically refined approaches to interpreting CO2 over the last 66 million years,"" said co-author Dustin Harper, a U postdoctoral researcher in Bowen's lab. ""Some of the new takeaways are we're able to combine multiple proxies from different archives of sediment, whether that's in the ocean or on land, and that really hasn't been done at this scale.""
The new research is a community effort involving some 90 scientists from 16 countries. Funded by dozens of grants from multiple agencies, the group hopes to eventually reconstruct the CO2 record back 540 million years to the dawn of complex life.
At the start of the Industrial Revolution -- when humans began burning to coal, then oil and gas to fuel their economies -- atmospheric CO2 was around 280 ppm. The heat-trapping gas is released into the air when these fossil fuels burn.
Looking forward, concentrations are expected to climb up to 600 to 1,000 ppm by the year 2100, depending on the rate of future emissions. It is not clear exactly how these future levels will influence the climate.
But having a reliable map of past CO2 levels could help scientists more accurately predict what future climates may look like, according to U biology professor William Anderegg, director the U's Wilkes Center for Climate & Policy.

""This is an incredibly important synthesis and has implications for future climate change as well, particularly the key processes and components of the Earth system that we need to understand to project the speed and magnitude of climate change,"" Anderegg said.
Today's 419 ppm is the highest CO2 in 14 million years
At times in the past when Earth was a far warmer place, levels of CO2 were much higher than now. Still, the 419 ppm recorded today represents a steep and perhaps dangerous spike and is unprecedented in recent geologic history.
""By 8 million years before present, there's maybe a 5% chance that CO2 levels were higher than today,"" Bowen said, ""but really we have to go back 14 million years before we see levels we think were like today.""
In other words, human activity has significantly altered the atmosphere within the span of a few generations. As a result, climate systems around the globe are showing alarming signs of disruption, such as powerful storms, prolonged drought, deadly heat waves and ocean acidification.
A solid understanding of atmospheric CO2 variation through geological time is also essential to deciphering and learning from various features of Earth's history. Changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate likely contributed to mass extinctions, as well as evolutionary innovations.
During the Cenozoic, for example, long-term declines in CO2 and associated climate cooling may have driven changes to plant physiology, species competition and dominance, which in turn impacted mammalian evolution.
""A more refined understanding of past trends in CO2 is therefore central to understanding how modern species and ecosystems arose and may fare in the future,"" the study states.

In this study, we critically evaluated, categorized, and integrated available proxies to create a high-fidelity and transparently constructed atmospheric CO 2 record spanning the past 66 million years.

Diverse and full of sea life, the Earth's Devonian era -- taking place more than 370 million years ago -- saw the emergence of the first seed-bearing plants, which spread as large forests across the continents of Gondwana and Laurussia.

However, a mass extinction event near the end of this era has long been the subject of debate. Some scientists argue the Late Devonian mass extinction was caused by large-scale volcanic eruptions, causing global cooling. Others argue a mass deoxygenation event caused by the expansion of land plants was to blame.
A recently published study in the journal Communications Earth and Environment led by researchers at IUPUI now posits that both factors played a role -- and draws attention to the environmental tipping points the planet faces today.
Filippelli and Gilhooly said the study's conclusion gives researchers a lot to consider. During the Devonian era, new biological outcomes on land produced negative effects for life in the ocean. In the present day, Gilhooly noted, activity like fertilizer runoff emptying into the ocean, combined with heating from fossil fuel combustion, are reducing oceans' oxygen levels. The previous outcome of this similar scenario in the Late Devonian had catastrophic outcomes, he said.
""Throughout Earth's history, there have been a series of biological innovations and geological events that have completely reshaped biological diversity and environmental conditions in the ocean and on land,"" Gilhooly said. ""In the Devonian era, a new biological strategy on land produced a negative impact for life in the ocean. This is a sobering observation when put in the context of modern global and climatic change driven by human activities. We have a lot to learn from Earth history that can help us think of strategies and actions to avoid future tipping points.""
Other contributors to the study were Kazumi Ozaki of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Christopher Reinhard of the Georgia Institute of Technology, John Marshall of the University of Southampton and Jessica Whiteside of San Diego State University.
The study is co-authored by School of Science at IUPUI faculty Gabriel Filippelli and William Gilhooly III. The lead author is Matthew Smart, an assistant professor of oceanography at the U.S. Naval Academy who was a graduate student in Filippelli's lab at the time of the study.

The work is the first to unify two competing Late Devonian extinction theories into a comprehensive cause-and-effect scenario. Essentially, the group concluded that both events -- mass volcanism and deoxygenation caused by land plants flushing excess nutrients into oceans -- needed to occur for the mass extinction to take place.
""The key to resolving this puzzle was identifying and integrating the timing and magnitude of the geochemical signals we determined using a sophisticated global model,"" Filippelli said. ""This modeling effort revealed that the magnitude of nutrient events we were seeing based on the geochemical records could drive substantial marine extinction events, but the duration of the events required both factors -- tree root evolution and volcanism -- to sustain the marine conditions that were toxic to organisms.""
With experts in sedimentology, paleontology, geochemistry, biogeochemistry and mathematical modeling, the group literally dug deep to geochemically analyze hundreds of samples scattered across different continents. These include samples from Ymer Island in eastern Greenland, home of some of the oldest rock samples on the planet.
""The process was highly interdisciplinary,"" Gilhooly said. ""This combined expertise created a rigorous approach to collecting the samples, correlating sequences in time, acquiring the chemical data and using geochemical models to test working hypotheses about the relative influences of biotically -- plants -- and chemically -- volcanoes -- driven triggers of mass extinction. Our analyses demonstrate that the influences are much more mixed than an either-or scenario.""

Multiple marine extinctions characterized by widespread anoxia, including the Late Devonian mass extinction around 372 million years ago, may have been linked to terrestrial release of the nutrient phosphorus driven by newly-rooted landscapes. Here we use recently published Devonian lake records as variable inputs in an Earth system model of the coupled carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus-oxygen-sulfur biogeochemical cycles to evaluate whether recorded changes to phosphorus fluxes could sustain Devonian marine anoxia sufficient to drive mass extinction. Results show that globally scaled increases in riverine phosphorus export during the Late Devonian mass extinction could have generated widespread marine anoxia, as modeled perturbations in carbon isotope, temperature, oxygen, and carbon dioxide data are generally consistent with the geologic record. Similar results for large scale volcanism suggest the Late Devonian mass extinction was likely multifaceted with both land plants and volcanism as contributing factors."

Baboons were raised in captivity before being mummified in Ancient Egyptian sites, according to a study published December 6, 2023 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Wim Van Neer of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Belgium and colleagues.

For over a millennium, from the 9th Century BC to the 4th Century AD, ancient Egyptians venerated and mummified various animal species for religious purposes. Included among these animals were baboons, notably species not native to ancient Egypt, and not much is known about how these animals were acquired and kept. In this study, the researchers examined a collection of baboon mummies from the ancient Egyptian site of Gabbanat el-Qurud, the so-called Valley of the Monkeys on the west bank of Luxor.
The team examined skeletal remains representing at least 36 individual baboons of varying ages, dated to between 800-500 BC. Lesions, deformations, and other abnormalities on the bones indicate that most of the baboons suffered from poor nutrition and a lack of sunlight, most likely as a result of being born and raised in captivity. The authors note that similar conditions are seen in baboon remains from two other sites of similar age, Saqqara and Tuna el-Gebel, suggesting a fairly consistent mode of captive keeping in all three sites.
These results provide insights into how baboons were kept and treated in Ancient Egypt before their eventual mummification, although more details remain to be explored. The authors suggest, for example, that further examination of the animals' teeth could provide more data on the diets they were fed, and if it is possible to extract DNA from these remains, genetic data might reveal information on where the animals were caught in the wild and what breeding practices their keepers were employing.
The authors add: ""Life was not easy for Egypt's sacred baboons. Scientific study shows they suffered from malnutrition and lack of sunlight.""

These species did not occur naturally in Egypt and therefore had to be imported, but little is known about their exact provenance and the conditions in which they were kept through time. Here, we analyse the skeletal remains of a collection of baboon mummies coming from Thebes (Egypt), representing a minimum of 36 individuals, from a palaeopathological and demographic point of view. The pathological cases are described, figured where relevant, and the discussion attempts to understand their aetiology. The prevalence of the different types of deformations and pathologies is compared with that of other captive baboon populations from more or less contemporary (Tuna el-Gebel and Saqqara) or older (predynastic Hierakonpolis) sites. This is combined with observations on the age and sex distribution and the proportion of hamadryas and anubis baboons to draw conclusions about the conditions of keeping, possible breeding on-site, provenance of the animals and the trade routes used for import. As in Tuna el-Gebel and Saqqara, the baboons from Gabbanat el-Qurud suffered from numerous metabolic diseases due to chronic lack of sunlight and an unbalanced diet. This and the demographic data suggest that there was a local breeding population derived from animals captured downstream from the Sudanese Nile Valley (for anubis) and from the Horn of Africa or the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula (for hamadryas). A new series of radiocarbon dates is provided, placing the baboons from Gabbanat el-Qurud between the end of the Third Intermediate Period and the beginning of the Late Period."

New research has shown that fire-ice -- frozen methane which is trapped as a solid under our oceans -- is vulnerable to melting due to climate change and could be released into the sea.

An international team of researchers led by Newcastle University found that as frozen methane and ice melts, methane -- a potent greenhouse gas -- is released and moves from the deepest parts of the continental slope to the edge of the underwater shelf. They even discovered a pocket which had moved 25 miles (40 kilometres).
Publishing in the journal Nature Geoscience, the researchers say this means that much more methane could potentially be vulnerable and released into the atmosphere as a result of climate warming.
Methane hydrate
Methane hydrate, also known as fire-ice, is an ice-like structure found buried in the ocean floor that contains methane. Vast amounts of methane are stored as marine methane under oceans. It thaws when the oceans warm, releasing methane into oceans and the atmosphere -- known as dissociated methane -- contributing to global warming.
The scientists used advanced three-dimensional seismic imaging techniques to examine the portion of the hydrate that dissociated during climatic warming off the coast of Mauritania in Northwest Africa. They identified a specific case where dissociated methane migrated over 40 kilometres and was released through a field of underwater depressions, known as pockmarks, during past warm periods.
Lead author, Professor Richard Davies, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Global and Sustainability, Newcastle University, said: ""It was a Covid lockdown discovery, I revisited imaging of strata just under the modern seafloor offshore of Mauritania and pretty much stumbled over 23 pockmarks. Our work shows they formed because methane released from hydrate, from the deepest parts of the continental slope vented into the ocean. Scientists had previously thought this hydrate was not vulnerable to climatic warming, but we have shown that some of it is.""
Researchers have previously studied how changes in bottom water temperature near continental margins can affect the release of methane from hydrates. However, these studies mainly focused on areas where only a small portion of global methane hydrates are located. This is one of only a small number that investigate the release of methane from the base of the hydrate stability zone, which is deeper underwater. The results show that methane released from the hydrate stability zone travelled a significant distance towards land.

Professor Dr Christian Berndt, Head of the Research Unit Marine Geodynamics, GEOMAR, in Kiel, Germany, added:
""This is an important discovery. So far, research efforts focused on the shallowest parts of the hydrate stability zone, because we thought that only this portion is sensitive to climate variations.
""The new data clearly show that far larger volumes of methane may be liberated from marine hydrates and we really have to get to the bottom of this to understand better the role of hydrates in the climate system.""
Methane is the second most abundant anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO2). Figures from the United States Environmental Protection Agency show that methane accounts for about 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
The study results can play a key role in helping to predict and address the impact of methane on our changing climate.
The team plan to continue to search for evidence of methane vents along the margin and try to predict where massive methane seeps are likely to occur as we warm the planet. The researchers are now planning a scientific cruise to drill into the pockmarks and see if they can more closely tie them to past climatic warming events.

The release of methane due to melting of hydrates is considered to be a mechanism for past global carbon-cycle perturbations and could exacerbate ongoing anthropogenic climate change. Increases in bottom-water temperature at the landward limit of marine hydrate around continental margins, where vulnerable hydrate exists at or below the seabed, cause methane to vent into the ocean. However, this setting represents only ~3.5% of the global hydrate reservoir. The potential for methane from hydrate in deeper water to reach the atmosphere was considered negligible. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) seismic imagery to show that, on the Mauritanian margin, methane migrated at least 40 km below the base of the hydrate stability zone and vented through 23 pockmarks at the shelf break, probably during warmer Quaternary interglacials. We demonstrate that, under suitable circumstances, some of the 96.5% of methane bound in deeper water distal hydrates can reach the seafloor and vent into the ocean beyond the landward limit of marine hydrate. This reservoir should therefore be considered for estimating climate change-induced methane release during a warming world."

What wiped out the dinosaurs? A meteorite plummeting to Earth is only part of the story, a new study suggests. Climate change triggered by massive volcanic eruptions may have ultimately set the stage for the dinosaur extinction, challenging the traditional narrative that a meteorite alone delivered the final blow to the ancient giants.

That's according to a study published in Science Advances, co-authored by Don Baker, a professor in McGill University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.
The research team delved into volcanic eruptions of the Deccan Traps -- a vast and rugged plateau in Western India formed by molten lava. Erupting a staggering one million cubic kilometres of rock, it may have played a key role in cooling the global climate around 65 million years ago.
The work took researchers around the world, from hammering out rocks in the Deccan Traps to analyzing the samples in England and Sweden.
A new season?: 'Volcanic winters'
In the lab, the scientists estimated how much sulfur and fluorine was injected into the atmosphere by massive volcanic eruptions in the 200,000 years before the dinosaur extinction.
Remarkably, they found the sulfur release could have triggered a global drop in temperature around the world -- a phenomenon known as a volcanic winter.

""Our research demonstrates that climatic conditions were almost certainly unstable, with repeated volcanic winters that could have lasted decades, prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs. This instability would have made life difficult for all plants and animals and set the stage for the dinosaur extinction event. Thus our work helps explain this significant extinction event that led to the rise of mammals and the evolution of our species,"" said Prof. Don Baker.
New technique
Uncovering clues within ancient rock samples was no small feat. In fact, a new technique developed at McGill helped decode the volcanic history.
The technique for estimating sulfur and fluorine releases-a complex combination of chemistry and experiments-is a bit like cooking pasta.
""Imagine making pasta at home. You boil the water, add salt, and then the pasta. Some of the salt from the water goes into the pasta, but not much of it,"" explains Baker.
Similarly, some elements become trapped in minerals as they cool following a volcanic eruption. Just as you could calculate salt concentrations in the water that cooked the pasta from analyzing salt in the pasta itself, the new technique allowed scientists to measure sulfur and fluorine in rock samples. With this information, the scientists could calculate the amount of these gases released during the eruptions.
The study involved researchers from Italy, Norway, Sweden, the UK, the United States and Canada.
Their findings mark a step forward in piecing together Earth's ancient secrets and pave the way for a more informed approach to our own changing climate.

We contribute to refining knowledge of the volcanic stressor by providing sulfur and fluorine budgets of Deccan lavas from the Western Ghats (India), which straddle the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Volcanic fluorine budgets were variable (400 to 3000 parts per million) and probably sufficient to affect the environment, albeit only regionally. The highest sulfur budgets (up to 1800 parts per million) are recorded in Deccan lavas emplaced just prior (within 0.1 million years) to the extinction interval, whereas later basalts are generally sulfur-poor (up to 750 parts per million). Independent evidence suggests the Deccan flood basalts erupted in high-flux pulses. Our data suggest that volcanic sulfur degassing from such activity could have caused repeated short-lived global drops in temperature, stressing the ecosystems long before the bolide impact delivered its final blow at the end of the Cretaceous."

Around 250 million years ago, 700 species of reptiles closely related to the modern-day crocodile roamed the earth, now new research reveals how a complex interplay between climate change, species competition and habitat can help explain why just 23 species of crocodile survive today.

The research team, led by scientists at the University of York, mapped the family tree of the ferocious ambush-predators and their extinct relatives known as Pseudosuchia. They then compared this with data from the fossil record to understand why crocodiles have so few living species, while there are 11,000 species of their closest living relatives, birds.
The researchers found that climate change and competition with other species have shaped the diversity of modern-day crocodiles and their extinct relatives, but the findings also reveal ecology -- whether species live in the sea, in freshwater or on land -- played an unexpectedly key role in survival.
The study, published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, found that when global temperatures rose, the number of species of the crocodile's sea-dwelling and land-based relatives went up, while increases in competition for resources, perhaps with sharks, marine reptiles or dinosaurs, likely brought about their extinction. By contrast, the crocodile's freshwater-dwelling relatives were not affected by temperatures, but were put at greatest risk of extinction by rising sea levels.
With seven species of crocodile categorised as Critically Endangered and a further four species identified as vulnerable, the findings of the study provide important insights for conservation efforts of crocodiles and other species as the climate continues to change.
Senior author of the study, Dr Katie Davis, from the Department of Biology at the University of York, said: ""The fossil record is a rich source of valuable information allowing us to look back through time at how and why species originate, and crucially, what drives their extinction. By examining this record and mapping it against the crocodile family tree, our research reveals how important it is to think about ecology when we're trying to predict how species might respond to today's climate change.
""With a million plant and animal species perilously close to extinction, understanding the key factors behind why species disappear has never been more important. In the case of crocodiles, many species reside in low-lying areas, meaning that rising sea levels associated with global warming may irreversibly alter the habitats on which they depend.""
Crocodiles and birds share their heritage with dinosaurs, and together with pterosaurs they form a group known as archosaurs or ""ruling reptiles,"" who date back to the Early Triassic. Pseudosuchia is a group of archosaurian reptiles, defined as all species more closely related to crocodiles than to birds.

For the study, the researchers built a large phylogeny, which is like a family tree, for all crocodiles and their extinct relatives, allowing them to map out how many new species were being formed and how many species were going extinct. They then combined this with data about past climate change, in particular temperature and sea level, to assess whether the emergence and extinction of species was linked to climate change.
The researchers also explored whether interactions between species, for example competition, might have played a role, so they calculated estimates of numbers of species at any point in time and compared these against new species and extinctions, using a type of mathematics called Information Theory. This allowed the scientists to produce an estimate of whether climate change and species interactions had a direct impact on whether new species were emerging or going extinct.
Dr Davis added: ""Crocodiles and their extinct relatives offer unique insights into climate change and its impact on biodiversity in the past, present and future. Our findings advance our understanding of what factors have shaped, and continue to shape, life on Earth.""

With a new time-calibrated tree of >500 species, we use a phylogenetic framework to reveal that pseudosuchian evolutionary history and diversification dynamics were directly shaped by the interplay of abiotic and biotic processes over hundreds of millions of years, supported by information theory analyses. Speciation, but not extinction, is correlated with higher temperatures in terrestrial and marine lineages, with high sea level associated with heightened extinction in non-marine taxa. Low lineage diversity and increased speciation in non-marine species is consistent with opportunities for niche-filling, whereas increased competition may have led to elevated extinction rates. In marine lineages, competition via increased lineage diversity appears to have driven both speciation and extinction. Decoupling speciation and extinction, in combination with ecological partitioning, reveals a more complex picture of pseudosuchian evolution than previously understood. As the number of species threatened with extinction by anthropogenic climate change continues to rise, the fossil record provides a unique window into the drivers that led to clade success and those that may ultimately lead to extinction."

Societies and political structures, like the humans they serve, appear to become more fragile as they age, according to an analysis of hundreds of pre-modern societies. A new study, which holds implications for the modern world, provides the first quantitative support for the theory that the resilience of political states decreases over time.

Triggers of societal collapse have been well studied and vary from conquest and coups to earthquakes and droughts. This new study shows that pre-modern states faced a steeply increasing risk of collapse within the first two centuries after they formed. The research identifies several mechanisms that could drive these aging effects. Some of the mechanisms, like environmental degradation and growing economic inequality, are still at work today.
The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, highlight the need to understand internal processes that may contribute to the demise of states, says SFI External Professor Tim Kohler (Washington State University).
""We tend to concentrate on external drivers such as drought or catastrophes. Yes, these have a role, but often they are just triggers that are effective, or not, depending on the internal dynamics of particular societies,"" says Kohler.
How states and great powers rise and fall has been an enigma that has puzzled historians for years. In this study, the researchers looked at this question from a new angle, by analyzing longevity in 324 pre-modern states spanning five millennia.
""This approach is commonly used to study the risk of death in aging humans, but nobody had the idea to look at societies this way,"" says SFI External Professor Marten Scheffer (Wageningen University), lead author of the study.
In humans, the risk of dying doubles approximately every 6-7 years after infancy. As that exponential process compounds with great age, few people survive more than 100 years. The authors show that it works differently for states. Their risk of termination rises steeply over the first two centuries but then levels off, allowing a few to persist much longer than usual.

They found a similar pattern all over the world from European pre-modern societies to early civilizations in the Americas to Chinese dynasties.
""Ancient Chinese states or dynasties had an upper limit of longevity around 300 years across the past two millennia. This middle-school textbook knowledge in China has a myriad of explanations, but no consensus has been reached,"" says co-author Chi Xu of Nanjing University in China. ""Perhaps the answer is underneath the global pattern of human civilizations -- what happened in ancient China is a perfect reflection that all societies will age and become vulnerable.""
Societies today differ in many ways from the pre-modern states studied by the authors. Nonetheless, according to Scheffer, humans should not expect modern societies to be immune to the mechanisms that drove the waxing and waning of states for thousands of years.
""Mechanisms that destabilized past societies remain relevant today,"" Sheffer says. ""Indeed, perceived unfairness and scarcity exacerbated by climatic extremes may still drive discontent and violence.""
Current threats to global society make these findings particularly applicable, adds co-author Tim Lenton from the University of Exeter.
""As our society enters a climate and ecological crisis of our own making the evidence that it is getting less resilient just increases the systemic and existential risks we are facing,"" he says. ""A glimmer of hope is that some past societies pulled through crises and lived much longer -- but they had to reinvent themselves in the process.""

A series of 'bone biographies' created by a major research project tell the stories of medieval Cambridge residents as recorded on their skeletons, illuminating everyday lives during the era of Black Death and its aftermath.

The work is published alongside a new study investigating medieval poverty by examining remains from the cemetery of a former hospital that housed the poor and infirm.
University of Cambridge archaeologists analysed close to 500 skeletal remains excavated from burial grounds across the city, dating between the 11th and 15th centuries. Samples came from a range of digs dating back to the 1970s.
The latest techniques were used to investigate diets, DNA, activities, and bodily traumas of townsfolk, scholars, friars and merchants. Researchers focused on sixteen of the most revealing remains that are representative of various ""social types.""
The full ""osteobiographies"" are available on a new website launched by the After the Plague project at Cambridge University.
""An osteobiography uses all available evidence to reconstruct an ancient person's life,"" said lead researcher Prof John Robb from Cambridge's Department of Archaeology. ""Our team used techniques familiar from studies such as Richard III's skeleton, but this time to reveal details of unknown lives -- people we would never learn about in any other way.""
""The importance of using osteobiography on ordinary folk rather than elites, who are documented in historical sources, is that they represent the majority of the population but are those that we know least about,"" said After the Plague researcher Dr Sarah Inskip (now at University of Leicester).

The project used a statistical analysis of likely names drawn from written records of the period to give pseudonyms to the people studied.
""Journalists report anonymous sources using fictitious names. Death and time ensure anonymity for our sources, but we wanted to them to feel relatable,"" said Robb.
Meet 92 ('Wat'), who survived the plague, eventually dying as an older man with cancer in the city's charitable hospital, and 335 ('Anne'), whose life was beset by repeated injuries, leaving her to hobble on a shortened right leg.
Meet 730 ('Edmund'), who suffered from leprosy but -- contrary to stereotypes -- lived among ordinary people, and was buried in a rare wooden coffin. And 522 ('Eudes'), the poor boy who grew into a square-jawed friar with a hearty diet, living long despite painful gout.
Inside the medieval benefits system
The website coincides with a study from the team published in the journal Antiquity, which investigates the inhabitants of the hospital of St. John the Evangelist.

Founded around 1195, this institution helped the ""poor and infirm,"" housing a dozen or so inmates at any one time. It lasted for some 300 years before being replaced by St. John's College in 1511. The site was excavated in 2010.
""Like all medieval towns, Cambridge was a sea of need,"" said Robb. ""A few of the luckier poor people got bed and board in the hospital for life. Selection criteria would have been a mix of material want, local politics, and spiritual merit.""
The study gives an inside look at how a ""medieval benefits system"" operated. ""We know that lepers, pregnant women and the insane were prohibited, while piety was a must,"" said Robb. Inmates were required to pray for the souls of hospital benefactors, to speed them through purgatory. ""A hospital was a prayer factory.""
Molecular, bone and DNA data from over 400 remains in the hospital's main cemetery shows inmates to be an inch shorter on average than townsfolk. They were more likely to die younger, and show signs of tuberculosis.
Inmates were more likely to bear traces on their bones of childhoods blighted by hunger and disease. However, they also had lower rates of bodily trauma, suggesting life in the hospital reduced physical hardship or risk.
Children buried in the hospital were small for their age by up to five years' worth of growth. ""Hospital children were probably orphans,"" said Robb. Signs of anaemia and injury were common, and about a third had rib lesions denoting respiratory diseases such as TB.
As well as the long-term poor, up to eight hospital residents had isotope levels indicating a lower-quality diet in older age, and may be examples of the ""shame-faced poor"": those fallen from comfort into destitution, perhaps after they became unable to work.
""Theological doctrines encouraged aid for the shame-faced poor, who threatened the moral order by showing that you could live virtuously and prosperously but still fall victim to twists of fortune,"" said Robb.
The researchers suggest that the variety of people within the hospital -- from orphans and pious scholars to the formerly prosperous -- may have helped appeal to a range of donors.
Finding the university scholars
The researchers were also able to identify some skeletons as probably those of early university scholars. The clue was in the arm bones.
Almost all townsmen had asymmetric arm bones, with their right humerus (upper arm bone) built more strongly than their left one, reflecting tough working regimes, particularly in early adulthood.
However, about ten men from the hospital had symmetrical humeri, yet they had no signs of a poor upbringing, limited growth, or chronic illness. Most dated from the later 14th and 15th century.
""These men did not habitually do manual labour or craft, and they lived in good health with decent nutrition, normally to an older age. It seems likely they were early scholars of the University of Cambridge,"" said Robb.
""University clerics did not have the novice-to-grave support of clergy in religious orders. Most scholars were supported by family money, earnings from teaching, or charitable patronage.
""Less well-off scholars risked poverty once illness or infirmity took hold. As the university grew, more scholars would have ended up in hospital cemeteries.""
Isotope work suggests the first Cambridge students came mainly from eastern England, with some from the dioceses of Lincoln and York.
Cambridge and the Black Death
Most remains for this study came from three sites. In addition to the Hospital, an overhaul of the University's New Museums Site in 2015 yielded remains from a former Augustinian Friary, and the project also used skeletons excavated in the 1970s from the grounds of a medieval parish church: 'All Saints by the Castle'.
The team laid out each skeleton to do an inventory, then took samples for radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis. ""We had to keep track of hundreds of bone samples zooming all over the place,"" said Robb
In 1348-9 the bubonic plague -- Black Death -- hit Cambridge, killing between 40-60% of the population. Most of the dead were buried in town cemeteries or plague pits such as one on Bene't Street next to the former friary.
However, the team have used the World Health Organization's methods of calculating ""Disease Adjusted Life Years"" -- the years of human life and life quality a disease costs a population -- to show that bubonic plague may have only come in tenth or twelfth on the risk rundown of serious health problems facing medieval Europeans.
""Everyday diseases, such as measles, whooping cough and gastrointestinal infections, ultimately took a far greater toll on medieval populations,"" said Robb.
""Yes, the Black Death killed half the population in one year, but it wasn't present in England before that, or in most years after that. The biggest threats to life in medieval England, and in Western Europe as a whole, were chronic infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.""
NOTES: Medieval Cambridge was home to just a few thousand people, with timber-framed houses clustered around a dozen churches, each with a small cemetery. A ten-minute walk in any direction ended in fields worked by many of the locals. Major Christian orders -- such as Dominicans and Franciscans -- had bases in the town, and the early University consisted of large hostels for religious students, with the first college, Peterhouse, established in 1284. Initially small and relatively poor, the colleges start to grow and multiply by the later 14th century thanks to endowments from aristocrats and royalty. By 1400 there were between 4-700 scholars. Remains from ""All Saints by the Castle,"" as well as from surrounding villages, had been in storage for decades, with some housed in the University's Duckworth Laboratory, and others held in an old salt mine in Cheshire. Analyses of townsfolk from the ""All Saints"" cemetery suggest an adequate diet, mainly grains, vegetables and a little dairy. Around half of this group did not survive childhood, but of those that did, around half made it past the age of 45. Men from the Augustinian Friary were around an inch taller than those from town, with bone chemistry suggesting diets rich with meat and fish. The hospital inmates were the shortest group, likely as a result of poor and disease-ridden childhoods. Three people from the hospital, including 332 ('Christina'), began life some distance away, maybe even as far as Norway. They may have been buried in the Hospital cemetery's consecrated ground as an act of charity, after dying while visiting Cambridge -- perhaps to trade at the town's famous Stourbridge Fair.

In early November of this year, aurora borealis were observed at surprisingly low latitudes, as far south as Italy and Texas. Such phenomena indicate the impacts of a solar coronal mass ejection on the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. Far more dramatic than this recent light show was, it was nothing compared to a huge solar storm in February 1872. The resulting auroral display from that event ringed the globe and produced auroras observed in sites as close to the equator as Bombay and Khartoum. An international team consisting of scientists from nine counties has now published a detailed study of this historically important event, tracing its solar origin and widespread terrestrial impacts. Telegraph communications were widely disrupted by this storm, but in today's technologically dependent society, such a storm would disrupt power grids and satellite communications. Their findings confirm that such extreme storms are more common than previously thought.

In the modern world, we are increasingly dependent on technological infrastructure such as power grids, communication systems, and satellites. However, this dependency makes us increasingly vulnerable to the effects of large geomagnetic storms. ""The longer the power supply could be cut off, the more society, especially those living in urban areas, will struggle to cope,"" Designated Assistant Professor Hayakawa, the lead author of the study, explains. Such storms could be big enough to knock out the power grid, communication systems, airplanes, and satellites in the worst case. ""Could we maintain our life without such infrastructure?"" Hayakawa comments: ""Well, let us just say that it would be extremely challenging.""
Such extreme storms are rare. In recent studies, two such storms stand out: the Carrington storm in September 1859 and the New York Railroad storm in May 1921. The new study suggests that another storm, the Chapman-Silverman storm in February 1872, should also be considered as one of these extreme events. At the time, the storm was big enough to affect the technological infrastructure even in the tropics. Telegraph communications on the submarine cable in the Indian Ocean between Bombay (Mumbai) and Aden were disrupted for hours. Similar disturbances were reported on the land line between Cairo and Khartoum.
The multidisciplinary team, consisting of 22 scientists, was led by Nagoya University in Japan (Hisashi Hayakawa), the US National Solar Observatory (Edward Cliver), and the Royal Observatory of Belgium (Frédéric Clette). The 22 researchers used historical records and modern techniques to assess the Chapman-Silverman storm from its solar origin to its terrestrial impacts. For the solar origin, the group turned to largely forgotten sunspot records from historical archives, especially Belgian and Italian records. For terrestrial impacts, they used geomagnetic field measurements recorded in places as diverse as Bombay (Mumbai), Tiflis (Tbilisi), and Greenwich to assess temporal evolution and storm intensity. They also examined hundreds of accounts of visual aurora in different languages caused by the storm.
One of the more interesting aspects of the 1872 storm was that it likely originated in a medium-sized, but complex, sunspot group near the solar disk centre as confirmed by analyses of solar records from Belgium and Italy. These findings suggest that even a medium-sized sunspot group triggered one of the most extreme magnetic storms in history.
Hayakawa and his colleagues extended their investigations of the historical aurorae by combing through records in libraries, archives, and observatories around the world. They identified more than 700 auroral records that indicated that the night sky was illuminated by magnificent auroral displays from the polar regions to the tropics (down to ≈ 20° in latitude in both hemispheres).
""Our findings confirm the Chapman-Silverman storm in February 1872 as one of the most extreme geomagnetic storms in recent history. Its size rivalled those of the Carrington storm in September 1859 and the NY Railroad storm in May 1921,"" Hayakawa said. ""This means that we now know that the world has seen at least three geomagnetic superstorms in the last two centuries. Space weather events that could cause such a major impact represent a risk that cannot be discounted.""
Hayakawa said: ""Such extreme events are rare. On the one hand, we are fortunate to have missed such superstorms in the modern time. On the other hand, the occurrence of three such superstorms in 6 decades shows that the threat to modern society is real. Therefore, the preservation and analysis of historical records is important to assess, understand, and mitigate the impact of such events.""
Recent auroral displays have been observed from northern Greece and the northern US. Currently, the Sun is approaching the maximum of Solar Cycle 25, predicted to occur in 2025, and we may expect enhanced auroral activity in the coming years.

There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9–10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of ≈29 hr to Earth.

Maize is one of the world's most widely grown crops. It is used for both human and animal foods and holds great cultural significance, especially for indigenous peoples in the Americas. Yet despite its importance, the origins of the grain have been hotly debated for more than a century. Now new research, published Dec. 1 in Science, shows that all modern maize descends from a hybrid created just over 5000 years ago in central Mexico, thousands of years after the plant was first domesticated.

The work has implications both for improving one of the world's most important crops and for understanding how the histories of people and their crops influence each other.
""It's a new model for the origins and spread of maize, and how it became a staple across the Americas,"" said Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra, professor in the Department of Evolution and Ecology at the University of California, Davis and senior author on the paper.
For the last few decades, the consensus has been that maize (Zea mays) was domesticated once from a single wild grass -- called teosinte -- in the lowlands of southwest Mexico about 9,000 to 10,000 years ago. Known as corn in the United States, maize is not only a staple of diets around the globe, but also can be processed into sweeteners,ethanol fuel and other uses.
More recently, though, it's become clear that the genome of modern maize also contains a hefty dose of DNA from a second teosinte that grows in the highlands of central Mexico.
Ross-Ibarra and collaborators in the U. S., China and Mexico analyzed the genomes of over a thousand samples of maize and wild relatives. They found that about 20 percent of the genome of all maize worldwide comes from this second highland teosinte.
New model for spread of maize
These new findings suggest that, though maize was domesticated around 10,000 years ago, it was not until 4,000 years later, when it hybridized with highland teosinte, that maize really took off as a popular crop and food staple. This is also supported by archaeological evidence of the increasing importance of maize around the same time.

The new crop spread rapidly through the Americas and later worldwide. Today, about 1.2 billion metric tons is harvested each year globally.
The hunt for why highland teosinte enabled maize to become a staple is still underway, Ross-Ibarra said. The researchers did find genes related to cob size -- perhaps representing an increased yield potential -- and flowering time, which likely helped maize, a tropical crop, to grow at higher latitudes with longer days.
Hybridization may also have brought ""hybrid vigor,"" where a hybrid organism is more vigorous than either of its parents. The researchers observed that genomic segments from highland teosinte contained fewer harmful mutations than did other parts of the genome.
While the initial hybridization may have been accidental, it's likely that indigenous farmers recognized and took advantage of the novel variation introduced from highland maize, Ross-Ibarra said. Even today, he said, ""If you talk to Mexican farmers, some will tell you that letting wild maize grow near the fields makes their crops stronger.""
A team led by Ross-Ibarra with Professor Graham Coop at UC Davis, archaeologists at UC Santa Barbara and geneticists at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences was recently awarded a $1.6 million grant from the National Science Foundation to study the co-evolution of humans and maize in the Americas. They will use genetics to look at how humans and maize spread across the continent and how populations of both maize and humans grew and shrank as they interacted with each other.
""We will incorporate human genetic data, maize genetics and archaeological data in an effort to answer many of the questions raised by our new model of maize origins,"" Ross-Ibarra said.
The work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Our population genetic analysis reveals that the origin of modern maize can be traced to an admixture between ancient maize and Zea mays ssp. mexicana in the highlands of Mexico some 4000 years after domestication began. We show that variation in admixture is a key component of maize diversity, both at individual loci and for additive genetic variation underlying agronomic traits. Our results clarify the origin of modern maize and raise new questions about the anthropogenic mechanisms underlying dispersal throughout the Americas."

Nineteen million years ago, during a time known as the early Miocene, massive ice sheets in Antarctica rapidly and repeatedly grew and receded. The Miocene is widely considered a potential analog for Earth's climate in the coming century, should humanity remain on its current carbon emissions trajectory.

Identifying how and why Antarctica's major ice sheets behaved the way they did in the early Miocene could help inform understanding of the sheets' behavior under a warming climate. Together, the ice sheets lock a volume of water equivalent to more than 50 meters of sea level rise and influence ocean currents that affect marine food webs and regional climates. Their fate has profound consequences for life nearly everywhere on Earth.
While fluctuations in Antarctica's ice sheets have, over the span of millions of years, grown and diminished at regular intervals tied to natural oscillations in Earth's journey in orbit, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and their collaborators around the world have uncovered evidence that Antarctica's ice sheets grew and shrank more frequently during the Miocene epoch than was previously known.
This new evidence, published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, indicates that between about 19.2 and 18.8 million years ago, the ice sheets grew and receded multiple times over cycles of just a few thousand years. That is much more rapidly than can be explained by periodic shifts in the planet's orbit and rotational axis, known as Milankovitch cycles, which typically advance slowly, altering Earth's climate and ice sheets over tens or hundreds of thousands of years.
""Our observation of this rapid volatility of the Antarctic ice sheets raises the interesting question of what's causing it,"" says Nick Sullivan, a 2022 UW-Madison PhD graduate who led the analysis for his dissertation research.
The study offers an unprecedented window into the sheets' past behavior, and it relies on a well-preserved sediment record from the Antarctic Drilling Project, or ANDRILL. The project was an international scientific collaboration to gather evidence of past climatic conditions via sediment and rock drilled from hundreds of meters below the Antarctic seabed.
In 2006 and 2007, drilling in McMurdo Sound off the coast of Antarctica in an area influenced by both of the continent's large ice sheets recovered detailed sediment records from the Miocene, close to the ice sheet.

""We could clearly see the influence of long-term climate cycles on ice sheet extent in the rock and sediment cores we recovered in 2007, but our initial observations weren't detailed enough to detect shorter-term changes,"" says co-author Richard Levy, a professor at Victoria University of Wellington and principal scientist at GNS Science, a public research institute in New Zealand.
The latest analysis led by Sullivan now allows scientists to ""document past ice sheet change on timescales as short as five centuries or so,"" says Stephen Meyers, a UW-Madison geoscience professor who worked with Sullivan in his analysis.
In fact, Meyers calls it a remarkable archive.
That's because it contains small bits of gravel that fell to the seafloor as icebergs drifted away from the ice sheets after breaking away. The amount of gravel in ocean sediment records ice sheet changes, such as when the edge of an ice sheet gets closer to or further away from that particular part of the seafloor.
While testing for evidence of Milankovitch cycles within the sediment, Sullivan found variations in the abundance of gravel, suggesting nearby ice sheets advanced and retreated in recurring intervals as brief as 1,200 years.
It's unclear what triggered the ice sheets to advance and retreat at these geologically frequent intervals, but the team proposes several potential causes based on prior studies of ice sheets.

One idea suggests that the ice sheets, building up over time, became steeper and top heavy, leading them to collapse. Another proposes that as thick ice sheets advanced over rough terrain, heat from friction helped to temporarily speed them up.
""There are likely multiple mechanisms that were going on and interacting with each other,"" says Sullivan, including variations in the local climate and the ocean.
Scientists around the world are working to better understand the many factors beyond Earth's orbit that control ice sheet behavior as the planet continues to warm. The early Miocene isn't perfectly analogous to today's world, but the new study suggests Antarctica's ice sheets could change rapidly and in unexpected ways in the coming centuries if carbon dioxide levels and temperatures continue to rise due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
""It was long thought that Antarctica's ice sheets remained large and stable over long periods of time. But the closer we look, the more we realize just how sensitive the ice sheets are to environmental change,"" says Levy. ""This insight is key as we consider the pace at which we need to adapt to future sea level rise driven by melt and retreat of our planet's ice sheets.""

Ice sheet variability at similar frequencies is comparatively less known and understood prior to the Quaternary during times, where higher atmospheric p CO 2 and warmer climates prevailed, and continental-scale ice sheets were largely restricted to Antarctica. In this study, we evaluate a high-resolution clast abundance dataset (ice-rafted debris) that captures East Antarctic ice sheet variability in the western Ross Sea during the early Miocene. This dataset is derived from a 100 m-thick mudstone interval in the ANtarctic DRILLing (ANDRILL or AND) core 2A, which preserves a record of precession and eccentricity variability. The sedimentation rates are of appropriate resolution to also characterize the signature of robust, subprecession cyclicity. Strong sub-precession (~10 kyr) cyclicity is observed, with an amplitude modulation in lockstep with eccentricity, indicating a relationship between high-frequency Antarctic ice sheet dynamics and astronomical forcing. Bicoherence analysis indicates that many of the observed millennial-scale cycles (as short as 1.2 kyr) are associated with nonlinear interactions (combination or difference tones) between each other and the Milankovitch cycles. The presence of these cycles during the Miocene reveals the ubiquity of millennial-scale ice sheet variability and sheds light on the interactions between Earth’s atmosphere, ocean, and ice in climates warmer than the Quaternary."

""Dripstones, or speleothems, are unique natural archives -- like Earth's USB sticks. They store a wealth of information on past climate which helps us to better understand the environment in which early humans lived,"" Jenny Maccali explains. She is a scientist at SapienCE Centre of Excellence, and has has lead the study, now published in Climate of the Past.

New perspective to ancient climate
South Africa has a highly dynamic climate resulting from its position at the convergence of two oceanic basins, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Indian Ocean to the east. The region is also located at the boundary of different climate zones (subtropical vs. temperate), and the proximity of the Antarctic ice sheet has a direct impact on its climate by influencing the easterlies and westerlies winds position, and hence rainfall pattern.
""All these factors mean that climate in the past could have been different from today and also possibly highly variable,"" Jenny Maccali says.
She says that it is particularly important given that the region hosts key archaeological sites with records of significant cognitive, technological, and social developments and it is important to understand the climatic conditions under which these occurred.
Archives for climate reconstruction
A recent study, Multi-proxy speleothem-based reconstruction of mid-MIS 3 climate in South Africa, undertaken by a team of scientists from SapienCE, used new techniques to reconstruct past climate and its variability.

Maccali and her team of researchers have focused on the subterranean world of caves, where they explore dripstones, also known as speleothems, to study past climate. The study is based on scientific analyses of speleothems from Bloukrantz Cave.
""Dripstones forming in caves are excellent archives for climate reconstructions, because their age can be accurately determined and a suite of methods can be used to reconstruct different aspects of past climate,"" Maccali says.
Insights to early human occupations
One of the dripstones from Bloukrantz cave, located on the southern coast of South Africa, provided the team with new climate data for a time window of 3000 years during the last glacial period -- from around 45,000 years ago. They used different methods that confirmed the average air temperature for this period of 18.8 ± 0.5 degrees Celsius, which was slightly warmer compared to the present day, possibly because the sea level was lower, and the site was further away from the coastline than today. In addition, we could show, again based on multiple methods, that rainfall was highly variable with repeated drying events.
""Combining these insights, our study was able to increase confidence in the methods that were being used and further work will likely provide a detailed picture of the climate around the early human occupations during a crucial time period in South Africa,"" Maccali says.

The southern coast of South Africa displays a highly dynamical climate as it is at the convergence of the Atlantic and Indian oceans, and it is located near the subtropical/temperate zone boundary with seasonal influence of easterlies and westerlies. The region hosts some key archeological sites with records of significant cognitive, technological and social developments. Reconstructions of the state and variability of past climate and environmental conditions around sites of archeological significance can provide crucial context for understanding the evolution of early humans. Here we present a short but high-resolution record of hydroclimate and temperature in South Africa. Our reconstructions are based on trace elements, calcite and fluid inclusion stable isotopes, as well as fluid inclusion microthermometry, from a speleothem collected in Bloukrantz cave, in the De Hoop Nature Reserve in the southern Cape region of South Africa. Our record covers the time period from 48.3 to 45.2 ka during marine isotope stage 3. Both δ18Oc and δ13Cc show strong variability and covary with Sr/Ca. This correlation suggests that the control on these proxies originates from internal cave processes such as prior carbonate precipitation, which we infer to be related to precipitation amount. The hydroclimate indicators furthermore suggest a shift towards overall drier conditions after 46 ka, coincident with cooling in Antarctica and drier conditions in the eastern part of South Africa corresponding to the summer rainfall zone (SRZ). Fluid inclusion-based temperature reconstructions show good agreement between the oxygen isotope and microthermometry methods, and results from the latter display little variation throughout the record, with reconstructed temperatures close to the present-day cave temperature of 17.5 ∘C. Overall, the BL3 speleothem record thus suggests relatively stable temperature from 48.3 to 45.2 ka, whereas precipitation was variable with marked drier episodes on sub-millennial timescales."

Ancient animals were walking around on bird-like feet over 210 million years ago, according to a study published November 29, 2023 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Miengah Abrahams and Emese M. Bordy of the University of Cape Town, South Africa.

Numerous fossil sites in southern Africa preserve distinctive three-toed footprints that have been named Trisauropodiscus. For many years, researchers have debated what animals might have left these tracks, as well as precisely how many different species (technically called ichnospecies) of Trisauropodiscus there are.
In this study, the researchers reassessed the fossil record of these footprints, examining physical fossil traces alongside published materials documenting Trisauropodiscus at four sites in Lesotho dating to the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic Periods. The authors also provided a detailed field-based description of footprints from an 80-meter-long tracksite in Maphutseng. They identified two distinct morphologies among Trisauropodiscus footprints, the first of which is similar to certain non-bird dinosaur tracks, and the second of which is very similar in size and proportions to the footprints of birds.
These tracks aren't a direct match for any fossil animals known from this region and time period. The most ancient of these footprints, at over 210 million years old, are 60 million years older than the earliest known body fossils of true birds. It's possible that these tracks were produced by early dinosaurs, and potentially even early members of a near-bird lineage, but the authors note that there could also have been other reptiles, cousins of dinosaurs, that convergently evolved bird-like feet. Whoever the trackmakers are, these footprints establish the origin of bird-like feet at least as early as the Late Triassic Period.
The authors add: ""Trisauropodiscus tracks are known from numerous southern African sites dating back to approximately 215 million years ago. The shape of the tracks is consistent with modern and more recent fossil bird tracks, but it is likely a dinosaur with a bird-like foot produced Trisauropodiscus.""

Consequently, fossil tracks can be used to infer ancient diversity, ethology, and evolutionary trends. This is particularly useful for deep-time intervals during which the early history of an animal group is reliant upon limited fossil skeletal material. Fossil tracks of early birds and theropods, the co-existing dinosaurian ancestors of birds, co-occur in the rock record since the Early Cretaceous. However, the evolutionary transition from dinosaur to bird and the timing of the birds’ origin are still contested. Skeletal remains of the basal-most birds Aurornis, Anchiornis, Archaeopteryx and Xiaotingia are Middle to Late Jurassic, while tracks with tentative bird affinities, attributed to dinosaurs, are known from as early as the Late Triassic. Here, we present numerous, well-provenanced, Late Triassic and Early Jurassic tridactyl tracks from southern Africa, with demonstrable bird-like affinities, predating basal bird body fossils by c. 60 million years."

The San Joaquin Valley in California has experienced vast variability in climate extremes, with droughts and floods that were more severe and lasted longer than what has been seen in the modern record, according to a new study of 600 years of tree rings from the valley.

The researchers used the tree rings to reconstruct plausible daily records of weather and streamflow scenarios during the 600-year period.
This new approach, combining paleo information with synthetic weather generation, may help policymakers and scientists better understand -- and anticipate -- California's flood and drought risks and how they will be compounded by climate change.
The group's paper published in Earth's Future, a journal of the American Geophysical Union.
The San Joaquin Valley sits in the southern part of California's Central Valley, a major agricultural hub from which much of the nation gets its produce. Over the last few years, the region has seen a wild swing between severe drought and significant atmospheric rivers, which makes the valley a bellwether for the climate hazards that are facing the rest of California and much of the world, according to Patrick Reed, professor of engineering at Cornell University, and co-senior author of the paper.
The models show how flood and drought extremes have evolved within the San Joaquin Valley and can help clarify how natural variability and climate change can compound each other's effects.
""Folks typically want to separate out internal variability versus climate change, just to get a sense of the signal change with anthropogenic warming,"" Reed said. ""But when we're planning in complex water systems, both are occurring. And we need a sense of what happens when they come together. And what happens is we get extremes we've never seen. This opens the envelope of plausible futures in a much wider sense.""
Among the findings: A large portion of variability in flood and drought extremes in the San Joaquin Valley can be attributed to natural variability in the short term, but human-driven climate changes are influential at durations longer than 30 years. The last 600 years have seen sustained pluvial and drought periods that have lasted decades. Estimates of drought occurrence and severity from the last 30 years rival the worst megadrought period in the 600-year reconstruction, but estimates of modern drought duration have been slightly shorter than what is found in the paleo record. Therefore, relying solely on the modern instrumental record can underrepresent hydroclimatic hazards. The combination of natural variability and climate change can lead to more frequent, more severe and longer flood and drought extremes than have ever been experienced over the last 600 years.The research was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

We use 600 years of paleo‐reconstructed weather regimes to force a stochastic weather generator, which we develop for five subbasins in the San Joaquin Valley of California. To assess the compound effects of climate change, we create temperature series that reflect projected scenarios of warming and precipitation series that have been scaled to reflect thermodynamically driven shifts in the distribution of daily precipitation. We then use these weather scenarios to force hydrologic models for each of the five subbasins. The paleo‐forced streamflow scenarios highlight periods in the region's past that produce flood and drought extremes that surpass those in the modern record and exhibit large non‐stationarity through the reconstruction. Variance decomposition is employed to characterize the contribution of natural variability and climate change to variability in decision‐relevant metrics related to floods and drought. Our results show that a large portion of variability in individual subbasin and spatially compounding extreme events can be attributed to natural variability, but that anthropogenic climate changes become more influential at longer planning horizons. The joint importance of climate change and natural variability in shaping extreme floods and droughts is critical to resilient water systems planning and management in the San Joaquin."

Around 400,000 years ago, early humans hunted beavers as a food resource and possibly also for their pelts. This is the conclusion of a team from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), the Leibniz Zentrum für Archäologie (LEIZA), also in Mainz, and Leiden University in the Netherlands. In their publication in the journal Scientific Reports, the authors show that Middle Pleistocene humans systematically fed on these smaller animals and hence had a more varied diet than thusfar known. Previously, the opinion was that that hominins of this age primarily subsisted on large mammals, such as bovids and rhinoceroses, for one simple reason:

""The remains of large mammals from this period are generally much better preserved than those of small ones, not to mention plant remains,"" says Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser, Professor in the Department of Ancient Studies/Section Pre- and Protohistoric Archaeology at JGU and Director of the Archaeological Research Centre and Museum for Human Behavioural Evolution, MONREPOS, in Neuwied, which is part of LEIZA. She authored the new study together with two colleagues, Lutz Kindler, also from JGU and MONREPOS, and Wil Roebroeks from Leiden University. ""Until now, cut marks on Palaeolithic beaver bones had been identified very rarely and on isolated bones only. Dietrich Mania's extensive and long-term excavations in Bilzingsleben yielded a large number of beaver remains. Their study has now revealed for the first time the long-term strategy behind the exploitation of these animals,"" she explains.
Targeted hunting of young adults
The researchers used magnifying glasses and digital microscopes to examine the approximately 400,000-year-old bones of at least 94 beavers, excavated several decades ago in Bilzingsleben, Thuringia. This enabled them to identify cut marks from stone tools that indicate intensive use of the carcasses. ""It is interesting that the remains in Bilzingsleben mainly represent young adult beavers,"" says Gaudzinski-Windheuser. 
This indicates that hominins back then would have deliberately hunted inexperienced but fully grown and fat-rich animals. Fat was a very important food resource during the Pleistocene. ""Until now, it was generally thought that people in Europe fed primarily on large game until around 50,000 years ago, and that this was an important difference to the more flexible dietary strategies of modern humans. We have now demonstrated that the hominin food spectrum was much broader much earlier,"" says Gaudzinski-Windheuser.

We present new data that contradict this view of Middle Pleistocene Lower Palaeolithic hominins: cut mark evidence demonstrating systematic exploitation of beavers, identified in the large faunal assemblage from the c. 400,000 years old hominin site Bilzingsleben, in central Germany. In combination with a prime-age dominated mortality profile, this cut mark record shows that the rich beaver assemblage resulted from repetitive human hunting activities, with a focus on young adult individuals. The Bilzingsleben beaver exploitation evidence demonstrates a greater diversity of prey choice by Middle Pleistocene hominins than commonly acknowledged, and a much deeper history of broad-spectrum subsistence than commonly assumed, already visible in prey choices 400,000 years ago."

Movement of rivers, mountains, oceans and sediment nutrients at the geological timescale are the central drivers of Earth's biodiversity, new research published today in Nature has revealed.

The research also shows that biodiversity evolves at similar rates to the pace of plate tectonics, the slow geological processes that drive the shape of continents, mountains and oceans.
""That is a rate incomparably slower than the current rates of extinction caused by human activity,"" said lead author Dr Tristan Salles from the School of Geosciences.
The research looks back over 500 million years of Earth's history to the period just after the Cambrian explosion of life, which established the main species types of modern life.
Dr Salles said: ""Earth's surface is the living skin of our planet. Over geological time, this surface evolves with rivers fragmenting the landscape into an environmentally diverse range of habitats.
""However, these rivers not only carve canyons and form valleys, but play the role of Earth's circulatory system as the main conduits for nutrient and sediment transfer from sources (mountains) to sinks (oceans).
""While modern science has a growing understanding of global biodiversity, we tend to view this through the prism of narrow expertise,"" Dr Salles said. ""This is like looking inside a house from just one window and thinking we understand its architecture.

""Our model connects physical, chemical and biological systems over half a billion years in five-million-year chunks at a resolution of five kilometres. This gives an unprecedented understanding of what has driven the shape and timing of species diversity,"" he said.
The discovery in 1994 of the ancient Wollemi pine species in a secluded valley in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney gives us a glimpse into the holistic role that time, geology, hydrology, climate and genetics play in biodiversity and species survival.
The idea that landscapes play a role in the trajectory of life on Earth can be traced back to German naturalist and polymath Alexander von Humboldt. His work inspired Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace, who were the first to note that animal species boundaries correspond to landscape discontinuities and gradients.
""Fast forwarding nearly 200 years, our understanding of how the diversity of marine and terrestrial life was assembled over the past 540 million years is still emerging,"" University of Sydney PhD student Beatriz Hadler Boggiani said.
""Biodiversity patterns are well identified from the fossil record and genetic studies. Yet, many aspects of this evolution remain enigmatic, such as the 100 million years delay between the expansion of plants on continents and the rapid diversification of marine life.""
In groundbreaking research a team of scientists -- from the University of Sydney, ISTerre at the French state research organisation CNRS and the University of Grenoble Alpes in France -- has proposed a unified theory that connects the evolution of life in the marine and terrestrial realms to sediment pulses controlled by past landscapes.

""Because the evolution of the Earth's surface is set by the interplay between the geosphere and the atmosphere, it records their cumulative interactions and should, therefore, provide the context for biodiversity to evolve,"" said Dr Laurent Husson from University of Grenoble Alpes.
Instead of considering isolated pieces of the environmental puzzle independently, the team developed a model that combines them and simulates at high resolution the compounding effect of these forces.
""It is through calibration of this physical memory etched in the Earth's skin with genetics, fossils, climate, hydrology and tectonics by which we have investigated our hypothesis,"" Dr Salles said.
Using open-source scientific code published by the team in Science in March, the detailed simulation was calibrated using modern information about landscape elevations, erosion rates, major river waters and the geological transport of sediment (known as sediment flux).
This allowed the team to evaluate their predictions over 500 million years using a combination of geochemical proxies and testing different tectonic and climatic reconstructions. The geoscientists then compared the predicted sediment pulses to the evolution of life in both the marine and terrestrial realms obtained from a compilation of paleontological data.
""In a nutshell, we reconstructed Earth landforms over the Phanerozoic era, which started 540 million years ago, and looked at the correlations between the evolving river networks, sediment transfers and known distribution of marine and plant families,"" University of Grenoble PhD student Manon Lorcery said.
When comparing predicted sediment flux into the oceans with marine biodiversity, the analysis shows a strong, positive correlation.
On land, the authors designed a model integrating sediment cover and landscape variability to describe the capacity of the landscape to host diverse species. Here again, they found a striking correlation between their proxy and plant diversification for the past 450 million years.
In his 1864 novel A Journey to the Centre of the Earth, Jules Verne attributes this to his fictitious hero, Professor Otto Lidenbrock:
""Animal life existed upon the Earth only in the secondary period, when a sediment of soil had been deposited by the rivers and taken the place of the incandescent rocks of the primitive period.""
Dr Salles said: ""This observation by Professor Lidenbrock to his nephew Axel fits strikingly well with our hypothesis. So, it should be no surprise that Jules Verne was greatly inspired by Humboldt's work.""

Yet, over the continents, the nearly monotonic expansion of life started later in the early part of the Phanerozoic eon1 than the expansion in the marine realm, where instead the number of genera waxed and waned over time2. A comprehensive evaluation of the changes in the geodynamic and climatic forcing fails to provide a unified theory for the long-term pattern of evolution of life on Earth. Here we couple climate and plate tectonics models to numerically reconstruct the evolution of the Earth’s landscape over the entire Phanerozoic eon, which we then compare to palaeo-diversity datasets from marine animal and land plant genera. Our results indicate that biodiversity is strongly reliant on landscape dynamics, which at all times determine the carrying capacity of both the continental domain and the oceanic domain. In the oceans, diversity closely adjusted to the riverine sedimentary flux that provides nutrients for primary production. On land, plant expansion was hampered by poor edaphic conditions until widespread endorheic basins resurfaced continents with a sedimentary cover that facilitated the development of soil-dependent rooted flora, and the increasing variety of the landscape additionally promoted their development."

Researchers have provided new insights into how ancestral elephants developed their dextrous trunks.

The study, published today as an eLife Reviewed Preprint, combines multiple analyses to reconstruct feeding behaviours in the extinct longirostrine elephantiforms- elephant-like mammals characterised by elongated lower jaws and tusks. The work is described by the editors as fundamental to our understanding of how the elongated lower jaw and long trunks evolved in these animals during the Miocene epoch, around 11-20 million years ago. It provides compelling evidence for the diversity of these structures in longirostrine gomphotheres, and their likely evolutionary responses to global climatic changes.
The findings may also shed light on why modern day elephants are the only animals able to feed themselves using their trunks.
Longirostrine gomphotheres are part of the proboscidean family -- a group of mammals including elephants and known for their elongated and versatile trunks. Longirostrine gomphotheres are notable as they underwent a prolonged evolutionary phase characterised by an exceptionally elongated lower jaw, or mandible, which is not found in later proboscideans. It is thought that their elongated mandible and trunk may have co-evolved in this group, but this change among early to late proboscideans remains incompletely understood.
""During the Early to Middle Miocene, gomphotheres flourished across Northern China,"" says lead author Dr. Chunxiao Li, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. ""Across species there was huge diversity in the structure of the long mandible. We sought to explain why proboscideans evolved the long mandible and why it subsequently regressed. We also wanted to explore the role of the trunk in these animals' feeding behaviours, and the environmental background for the co-evolution of their mandibles and trunks.""
Li and colleagues used comparative functional and eco-morphological investigations, as well as a feeding preference analysis, to reconstruct the feeding behaviour of three major families of longirostrine gomphotheres: Amebelodontidae, Choerolophodontidae and Gomphotheriidae.
To construct the feeding behaviours and determine the relation between the mandible and trunk, the team examined the crania and lower jaws of the three groups, sourced from three different museums. The structure of the mandible and tusks differed across the three groups, indicating differences in feeding behaviours. The mandibles of Amebelodontidae were generally shovel-like and the tusks were flat and wide. Gomphotheriidae had clubbed lower tusks and a more narrow mandible, while Choerolophodontidae completely lacked mandibular tusks and their lower jaw was long and trough-like.

Next, the team conducted an analysis of the animals' enamel isotopes to determine the distribution and ecological niches of the three families. The results indicated that Choerolphontidae lived in a relatively closed environment, whereas Platybelodon, a member of the Amebelodontidae family, lived in a more open habitat, such as grasslands. Gomphotheriidae appeared to fill a niche somewhere in between these closed and open habitats.
A Finite Element analysis helped the team determine the advantages and disadvantages of the mandible and tusk structure between each group. Their data indicated that the Choerolophodontidae mandible was specialised for cutting horizontally or slanted-growing plants, which may explain the absence of mandibular tusks. The Gomphotheriidae mandible was found to be equally suited for cutting plants growing in all directions. Platybelodon had structures specialised for cutting vertically growing plants, such as soft-stemmed herbs, which would have been more common in open environments.
The three families also showed differences in their stages of trunk evolution, which could be inferred from the narial structure -- the region surrounding the nostrils. The narial region in Choerolophodontidae suggested that they had a relatively primitive, clumsy trunk. In Gomphotheriidae, the narial region was most similar to modern day elephants, suggesting they had a relatively flexible trunk. The trunks of Platybelodons may be the first example of a proboscidean trunk with the ability to coil and grasp. The evolutionary level of the trunk appeared to relate to the ability of the mandible to cut horizontally, strongly suggesting a co-evolution between the trunk and the mandible in longirostrine gomphotheres.
During the Mid-Miocene Climate Transition, which caused regional drying and the expansion of more open ecosystems, Choerolophodontidae experienced a sudden regional extinction and Gomphotheriidae numbers also declined in Northern China. The study suggests that the development of the coiling and grasping trunk in Platybelodon allowed this group to survive in greater numbers in their open environments. This may also explain why other animals with trunks, such as tapirs, never developed such dextrous trunks as elephants, as they never moved into open lands.
""Our cross-disciplinary team is dedicated to introducing multiple quantitative research methods to explore paleontology,"" says co-author Ji Zhang, associate professor of structural engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. ""Modern computational mechanics and statistics have injected new vitality into traditional fossil research.""
The main limitation of this work is the lack of discussion comparing the team's results with the development of gigantism and long limbs in proboscideans from the same period, according to eLife's editors. The authors add that such analysis could add to our understanding of how changing feeding behaviours related to wider differences in the animals' body shapes and sizes during this time.
""Our findings demonstrate that multiple eco-adaptations have contributed to the diverse mandibular structure found in proboscideans,"" concludes senior author Dr. Shi-Qi Wang, professor at the Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ""Initially, the elongated mandible served as the primary feeding organ in proboscideans, and was a prerequisite for the development of the extremely long trunk. Open-land grazing drove the development of trunk coiling and grasping functions, and the trunk then became the primary tool for feeding, leading to the gradual loss of the long mandible. In particular, Platybelodons may have been the first proboscidean to evolve this grazing behaviour.""

Through comparative functional and eco-morphological investigations, as well as feeding preference analysis, we reconstructed the feeding behavior of major groups of longirostrine elephantiforms. In the Platybelodon clade, the rapid evolutionary changes observed in the narial region, strongly correlated with mandible and tusk characteristics, suggest a crucial evolutionary transition where feeding function shifted from the mandible to the trunk, allowing proboscideans to expand their niches to more open regions. This functional shift further resulted in elephantids relying solely on their trunks for feeding. Our research provides insights into how unique environmental pressures shape the extreme evolution of organs, particularly in large mammals that developed various peculiar adaptations during the late Cenozoic global cooling trends."

Scientists have made a surprising discovery that sheds new light on the role that oceanic deoxygenation (anoxia) played in one of the most devastating extinction events in Earth's history. Their finding has implications for current day ecosystems -- and serves as a warning that marine environments are likely more fragile than apparent.

New research, published today in leading international journal Nature Geosciences, suggests that oceanic anoxia played an important role in ecosystem disruption and extinctions in marine environments during the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction, a major extinction event that occurred around 200 million years ago.
Surprisingly however, the study shows that the global extent of euxinia (an extreme form of de-oxygenated conditions) was similar to the present day.
Earth's history has been marked by a handful of major mass extinctions, during which global ecosystems collapsed and species went extinct. All past extinction events appear to have coincided with global climatic and environmental perturbance that commonly led to ocean deoxygenation. Because of this, oceanic anoxia has been proposed as a likely cause of marine extinctions at those times, with the assumption that the more widespread occurrence of deoxygenation would have led to a larger extinction event.
Using chemical data from ancient mudstone deposits obtained from drill-cores in Northern Ireland and Germany, an international research team led by scientists from Royal Holloway (UK), and including scientists from Trinity College Dublin's School of Natural Sciences (Ireland) as well as from Utrecht University (Netherlands), was able to link two key aspects associated with the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction.
The team discovered that pulses in deoxygenation in shallow marine environments along the margins of the European continent at that time directly coincided with increased extinction levels in those places.
On further investigation -- and more importantly -- the team also found that the global extent of extreme deoxygenation was rather limited, and similar to the present day.

Micha Ruhl, Assistant Professor in Trinity's School of Natural Sciences, and research-team member, said:
""Scientists have long suspected that ocean deoxygenation plays an important role in the disturbance of marine ecosystems, which can lead to the extinction of species in marine environments. The study of past time intervals of extreme environmental change indeed shows this to be the case, which teaches us important lessons about potential tipping points in local, as well as global ecosystems in response to climatic forcing.
""Crucially however, the current findings show that even when the global extent of deoxygenation is similar to the present day, the local development of anoxic conditions and subsequent locally increased extinction rates can cascade in widespread or global ecosystem collapse and extinctions, even in areas where deoxygenation did not occur.
""It shows that global marine ecosystems become vulnerable, even when only local environments along the edges of the continents are disturbed. Understanding such processes is of paramount importance for assessing present day ecosystem stability, and associated food supply, especially in a world where marine deoxygenation is projected to significantly increase in response to global warming and increased nutrient run-off from continents.""
The study of past global change events, such as at the transition between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, allows scientists to disentangle the consequences of global climatic and environmental change and constrain fundamental Earth system processes that control tipping points in Earth's ecosystems.

The marine extinction was initiated by large igneous province volcanism and has tentatively been linked to the spread of anoxic conditions. However, the global-scale pattern of anoxic conditions across the end-Triassic event is not well constrained. Here we use the sedimentary enrichment and isotopic composition of the redox-sensitive element molybdenum to reconstruct global–local marine redox conditions through the extinction interval. Peak δ98Mo values indicate that the global distribution of sulfidic marine conditions was similar to the modern ocean during the extinction interval. Meanwhile, Tethyan shelf sediments record pulsed, positive δ98Mo excursions indicative of locally oxygen-poor, sulfidic conditions. We suggest that pulses of severe marine de-oxygenation were restricted largely to marginal marine environments during the latest Triassic and played a substantial role in shallow-marine extinction phases at that time. Importantly, these results show that global marine biodiversity, and possibly ecosystem stability, were vulnerable to geographically localized anoxic conditions. Expanding present-day marine anoxia in response to anthropogenic marine nutrient supply and climate forcing may therefore have substantial consequences for global biodiversity and wider ecosystem stability."

The national park of Koli in eastern Finland is home to a famous, 34-metre-long crevice cave known as Pirunkirkko, or Devil's Church in English. In folklore, this crevice cave was known as a place where local sages would meet to contact the spirit world. Even today, the place is visited by practitioners of shamanism, who organise drumming sessions in the cave.

A new article by Riitta Rainio, a researcher of archaeology at the University of Helsinki, and Elina Hytönen-Ng, a researcher of cultural studies at the University of Eastern Finland, investigates the acoustics of the Devil's Church and explores whether the acoustic properties of the cave could explain the beliefs associated with it, and why it was chosen as a place for activities and rituals involving sound.
The researchers found that the Devil's Church houses a distinct resonance phenomenon that amplifies and lengthens sound at a specific frequency. This phenomenon may have significantly impacted the beliefs and experiences associated with the cave.
Resonance as a booster of healing rituals and drumming sessions
The researchers reviewed historical archives showing that several known sages and healers operated in the Koli area. The most famous of the sages was a man known as Kinolainen, sometimes also referred to as Tossavainen, who used the Devil's Church for magical rituals.
""According to folklore, Kinolainen would take his patients to the 'church' to talk with the Devil about the causes and cures of their ailments. This kind of a healing ritual often included loud yelling, stomping, shooting and banging,"" Rainio says, summarising traditional records.
Hytönen-Ng also interviewed and observed a modern-day practitioner of shamanism who uses the Devil's Church for rituals. According to the practitioner, there is a special energy in the cave, creating a strong connection to the surrounding nature and to one's own roots.

""The practitioner told in the interview that drumming sessions especially at the back of the cave have opened up 'new horizons'.""
According to Rainio, acoustic measurements conducted in the corridor-like, smooth walled back of the cave show a strong resonance phenomenon. The phenomenon is caused by a standing wave between the smooth parallel walls, generating a tone at the natural frequency of the cave, 231 Hz, that stays audible for around one second after sharp impulses, such as clapping, drumming or loud bangs.
Tones vocalised in the cave near the 231 Hz frequency are amplified and lengthened by the cave.
""We recorded the shamanic practitioner and found that they repeatedly vocalised tones at 231 Hz, which were then amplified by the cave at its natural frequency.""
A rare phenomenon in the natural environment
Resonance is a common phenomenon in the built environment, especially in small rooms, but it is rare in the natural environment where smooth and solid, parallel surfaces are rarely found. According to the researchers, it can therefore be assumed that the resonance occurring in the innermost part of the Devil's Church has been an exceptional sound phenomenon for the people living in the region centuries ago.

Similar distinct resonances in the natural environment have been measured, for example, in the Palaeolithic caves of France and Spain, occurring especially near paintings on cave walls.
Rainio and Hytönen-Ng suspect that a resonance-amplified, persistent tone has probably been audible on the background of rituals performed in the Devil's Church. According to the researchers, the effect of this resonance may have been subtle and unconscious, yet it may have significantly shaped the beliefs and experiences associated with the cave.
""Where a researcher of acoustics hears as resonance, people of the past may have sensed the presence of a spirit, and a shamanic practitioner may feel the presence of an exceptional energy, each according to their background.""
The study thus provides an example of how resonance can be used to establish concrete communication and dialogue with a physical space, site or the natural environment.
The study in the field of archaeoacoustics was funded by the Academy of Finland. The study was carried out in collaboration between researchers from the University of Helsinki and the University of Eastern Finland. This research continues in a project funded by the Kone Foundation (2023-2026) in which the research group examines the historical and current acoustic traditions of Fennoscandia. An audio-visual virtual reality reconstruction of the Devil's Church in Koli is currently underway for research and demonstration purposes.

A standing wave between the parallel walls generates a ringing tone at 219–232 Hz that stays audible after sharp impulses or vocalisations at the same frequency. The local folklore or the interviewed practitioner does not mention this phenomenon at all. Instead, they speak about the “spirit of the cave,” “special energy,” or “new horizons” opened up by drumming.

For 200 years, scientists have failed to grow a common mineral in the laboratory under the conditions believed to have formed it naturally. Now, a team of researchers from the University of Michigan and Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan have finally pulled it off, thanks to a new theory developed from atomic simulations.

Their success resolves a long-standing geology mystery called the ""Dolomite Problem."" Dolomite -- a key mineral in the Dolomite mountains in Italy, Niagara Falls, the White Cliffs of Dover and Utah's Hoodoos -- is very abundant in rocks older than 100 million years, but nearly absent in younger formations.
""If we understand how dolomite grows in nature, we might learn new strategies to promote the crystal growth of modern technological materials,"" said Wenhao Sun, the Dow Early Career Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at U-M and the corresponding author of the paper published today in Science.
The secret to finally growing dolomite in the lab was removing defects in the mineral structure as it grows. When minerals form in water, atoms usually deposit neatly onto an edge of the growing crystal surface. However, the growth edge of dolomite consists of alternating rows of calcium and magnesium. In water, calcium and magnesium will randomly attach to the growing dolomite crystal, often lodging into the wrong spot and creating defects that prevent additional layers of dolomite from forming. This disorder slows dolomite growth to a crawl, meaning it would take 10 million years to make just one layer of ordered dolomite.
Luckily, these defects aren't locked in place. Because the disordered atoms are less stable than atoms in the correct position, they are the first to dissolve when the mineral is washed with water. Repeatedly rinsing away these defects -- for example, with rain or tidal cycles -- allows a dolomite layer to form in only a matter of years. Over geologic time, mountains of dolomite can accumulate.
To simulate dolomite growth accurately, the researchers needed to calculate how strongly or loosely atoms will attach to an existing dolomite surface. The most accurate simulations require the energy of every single interaction between electrons and atoms in the growing crystal. Such exhaustive calculations usually require huge amounts of computing power, but software developed at U-M's Predictive Structure Materials Science (PRISMS) Center offered a shortcut.
""Our software calculates the energy for some atomic arrangements, then extrapolates to predict the energies for other arrangements based on the symmetry of the crystal structure,"" said Brian Puchala, one of the software's lead developers and an associate research scientist in U-M's Department of Materials Science and Engineering.

That shortcut made it feasible to simulate dolomite growth over geologic timescales.
""Each atomic step would normally take over 5,000 CPU hours on a supercomputer. Now, we can do the same calculation in 2 milliseconds on a desktop,"" said Joonsoo Kim, a doctoral student of materials science and engineering and the study's first author.
The few areas where dolomite forms today intermittently flood and later dry out, which aligns well with Sun and Kim's theory. But such evidence alone wasn't enough to be fully convincing. Enter Yuki Kimura, a professor of materials science from Hokkaido University, and Tomoya Yamazaki, a postdoctoral researcher in Kimura's lab. They tested the new theory with a quirk of transmission electron microscopes.
""Electron microscopes usually use electron beams just to image samples,"" Kimura said. ""However, the beam can also split water, which makes acid that can cause crystals to dissolve. Usually this is bad for imaging, but in this case, dissolution is exactly what we wanted.""
After placing a tiny dolomite crystal in a solution of calcium and magnesium, Kimura and Yamazaki gently pulsed the electron beam 4,000 times over two hours, dissolving away the defects. After the pulses, dolomite was seen to grow approximately 100 nanometers -- around 250,000 times smaller than an inch. Although this was only 300 layers of dolomite, never had more than five layers of dolomite been grown in the lab before.
The lessons learned from the Dolomite Problem can help engineers manufacture higher-quality materials for semiconductors, solar panels, batteries and other tech.
""In the past, crystal growers who wanted to make materials without defects would try to grow them really slowly,"" Sun said. ""Our theory shows that you can grow defect-free materials quickly, if you periodically dissolve the defects away during growth.""
The research was funded by the American Chemical Society PRF New Doctoral Investigator grant, the U.S. Department of Energy and the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science.

A mysterious counterexample is dolomite CaMg(CO 3 ) 2 , a geologically abundant sedimentary mineral that does not readily grow at ambient conditions, not even under highly supersaturated solutions. Using atomistic simulations, we show that dolomite initially precipitates a cation-disordered surface, where high surface strains inhibit further crystal growth. However, mild undersaturation will preferentially dissolve these disordered regions, enabling increased order upon reprecipitation. Our simulations predict that frequent cycling of a solution between supersaturation and undersaturation can accelerate dolomite growth by up to seven orders of magnitude. We validated our theory with in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy, directly observing bulk dolomite growth after pulses of dissolution. This mechanism explains why modern dolomite is primarily found in natural environments with pH or salinity fluctuations. More generally, it reveals that the growth and ripening of defect-free crystals can be facilitated by deliberate periods of mild dissolution."

An estimated 50,000 shipwrecks can be found around the UK's coastline and have been acting as a hidden refuge for fish, corals and other marine species in areas still open to destructive bottom towed fishing, a new study has shown.

Many of these wrecks have been lying on the seabed for well over a century, and have served as a deterrent to fishers who use bottom towed trawling to secure their catches.
As a result, while many areas of the seabed have been damaged significantly in areas of heavy fishing pressure, the seabed in and around shipwrecks remains largely unblemished.
The new research found that the average density of marine life in areas still open to trawling was 240% greater within wreck sites than in sites actively being used for bottom towed fishing.
In parts of the seabed within a 50m radius of the wrecks, the difference was even greater with the density of marine life 340% greater than in the control sites.
Conversely, in sites closed to trawling, the abundance was 149% greater than on wrecks and 85% greater than on the seabed within a 50m radius of the wrecks.
The study, conducted by the University of Plymouth and Blue Marine Foundation, has been published in the journal Marine Ecology, and is the first to demonstrate the increased ecological importance of shipwrecks -- and the areas surrounding them -- in areas of heavy fishing pressure.

Jenny Hickman, the study's lead author, completed the research as part of her MSc Marine Conservation programme at the University of Plymouth.
She said: ""The industrial use of bottom towed fishing gear has been commonplace since the 1800s, and has significantly altered marine communities and ecosystem services. Outside of legal protection, only areas inaccessible to trawlers are offered any protection, which is why shipwreck sites are rarely subject to trawling pressure. As many have been in situ for more than 100 years, they offer a baseline of ecological potential when trawling pressure is reduced or removed.""
The research was conducted around five shipwrecks off the Berwickshire coast, which are all thought to have sunk in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Constructed from a range of different materials, they sit between 17 and 47metres beneath the ocean surface, with some in areas open to bottom towed fishing and others in areas where some types of fishing are restricted.
The research teams, supported by local boat crews, gathered video footage of the shipwrecks, the surrounding 50m radius, and control locations more than 150m from the wreck site.
Footage of all the sites was then assessed, with the researchers, who had a particular interesting in finding species deemed to be vulnerable to trawling if it is allowed to continue.

Joe Richards, Scotland Project Manager for Blue Marine Foundation and one of the study's co-authors, said: ""It has long been thought that shipwrecks could be playing an important role in providing sanctuary for marine species to utilise. It is brilliant to see this proven in this study. The research provides and insight into what might be possible if bottom towed fishing activity is reduced. This feeds into our wider understanding of shipwrecks potential to contribute to ecosystem recovery and enhancement, given the sheer number found on the seabed.""
The University and the Blue Marine Foundation have worked together for many years examining the benefits of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).
This has included studies in the Lyme Bay MPA -- off the South Coast of England -- which have provided foundational evidence for the UK Government's current approach to MPA management.
Researchers say the latest study demonstrates the importance of factoring wreck sites into future conservation plans, but also the benefits of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) status.
Dr Emma Sheehan, Associate Professor of Marine Ecology and senior author, added: ""In recent years, the UK has made significant strides in terms of measures to protect the marine environment. There is still much to be done to reach the goal of having 30% of the ocean protected by 2030, but if we are to get close to that we need detailed evidence about what makes our ocean so special and any existing initiatives that are working well.

Outside of legal protection, only areas inaccessible to trawlers are offered any protection. Shipwrecks present hazards to fishing gear and are rarely subject to trawling pressure. As many have been in situ for >100 years, they offer a baseline of ecological potential when trawling pressure is reduced or removed. Five shipwrecks were surveyed off the Berwickshire coast, some within the Static Gear Reserve and others outside. Video transects were collected of shipwrecks, the surrounding 50 m radius and control locations >150 m from the wreck site. Species identified were assigned a category based on their vulnerability to trawling. The effect of distance from a shipwreck on ecological communities within sites Open and Closed to trawling was investigated. The ecological importance of shipwrecks increased relative to trawling pressure. In Open sites, abundance was 340% greater on Wreck locations than Control. Conversely, within Closed sites, abundance was 149% greater in Control locations than Wreck. In Open sites, shipwreck communities are more similar to those in Closed sites, than to the habitat surrounding the shipwreck. Vulnerable species, mostly large, sessile filter feeders, are almost entirely absent from Open sites, but account for ~28% of the total abundance on shipwrecks in Closed sites. This study offers a quantifiable method to evaluate the ecological contribution of shipwrecks in disturbed areas and suggests their role may warrant further research, and consideration in conservation policy, such as inclusion in 30 × 30 objectives. Our findings also demonstrate the possible ecological gains of expanding or including static gear reserves across Marine Protected Areas."

E. coli bacteria may be far more capable at evolving antibiotic resistance than scientists previously thought, according to a new study published in Science onNovember 24.

Led by SFI External Professor Andreas Wagner, the researchers experimentally mapped more than 260,000 possible mutations of an E. coli protein that is essential for the bacteria's survival when exposed to the antibiotic trimethoprim.
Over the course of thousands of highly realistic digital simulations, the researchers then found that 75% of all possible evolutionary paths of the E. coli protein ultimately endowed the bacteria with such a high level of antibiotic resistance that a clinician would no longer give the antibiotic trimethoprim to a patient.
""In essence, this study suggests that bacteria like E. coli may be more adept at evolving resistance to antibiotics than we initially thought, and this has broader implications for understanding how various systems in evolutionary biology, chemistry, and other fields adapt and evolve,"" says Wagner, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Zurich in Switzerland.
Besides uncovering new and potentially worrisome findings about antibiotic resistance, the researchers' work also casts doubt on a longstanding theory about fitness landscapes. These genetic maps represent how well an organism -- or a part of it, like a protein -- adapts to its environment.
On fitness landscapes, different points on the landscape represent different genotypes of an organism, and the height of these points represents how well each genotype is adapted to its environment. In evolutionary biology terms, the goal is to find the highest peak, which indicates the fittest genotype.
Prevailing theory regarding fitness landscapes predicts that in highly rugged landscapes, or those with multiple peaks of fitness, most evolving populations will become trapped at lower peaks and never reach the pinnacle of evolutionary adaptation.

However, testing this theory has been exceedingly difficult until now due to the lack of experimental data on sufficiently large fitness landscapes.
To address this challenge, Wagner and colleagues used CRISPR gene editing technology to create one of the most combinatorially complete fitness landscapes to date for the E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein.
What they found was surprising. The landscape had many peaks, but most were of low fitness, making them less interesting for adaptation. However, even in this rugged landscape, about 75% of the populations they simulated reached high fitness peaks, which would grant E. coli high antibiotic resistance.
The real-world implications are significant. If rugged landscapes like this are common in biological systems, it could mean that many adaptive processes, such as antibiotic resistance, may be more accessible than previously thought.
The result could ultimately lead to a re-evaluation of theoretical models in various fields and prompt further research into how real-world landscapes impact evolutionary processes.
""This has profound implications not only in biology but beyond, prompting us to reevaluate our understanding of landscape evolution across various fields,"" Wagner says. ""We need to shift from abstract theoretical models to data-informed, realistic landscape models.""

The resulting landscape is highly rugged and harbors 514 fitness peaks. However, its highest peaks are accessible to evolving populations via abundant fitness-increasing paths. Different peaks share large basins of attraction that render the outcome of adaptive evolution highly contingent on chance events. Our work shows that ruggedness need not be an obstacle to Darwinian evolution but can reduce its predictability. If true in general, the complexity of optimization problems on realistic landscapes may require reappraisal."

The Iron Age site of Casas del Turuñuelo was used repeatedly for ritualized animal sacrifice, according to a multidisciplinary study published November 22, 2023 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Mª Pilar Iborra Eres of the Institut Valencià de Conservació, Restauració i Investigació, Spain, Sebastián Celestino Pérez of Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Spain, and their colleagues.

Archaeological sites with evidence of major animal sacrifices are rarely known from the Iron Age of the Mediterranean region, and there is a gap between information offered by written sources and by the archaeological record. This makes it difficult to establish a clear understanding of the patterns and protocols of this practice. In this study, researchers examine a well-preserved example of mass animal sacrifice from an Iron Age building in southwest Spain known as Casas del Turuñuelo, associated to Tartessos and dating toward the end of the 5th Century BCE.
The authors examined and dated 6770 bones belonging to 52 sacrificed animals which were buried in three sequential phases. The identified animals were predominantly adult horses, with smaller numbers of cattle and pigs and one dog. In the first two phases, skeletons were mostly complete and unaltered, but in the third phase, skeletons (except equids) show signs of having been processed for food, suggesting that some sort of meal accompanied this ritual. These data indicate that this space was used repeatedly over several years for sacrificial rituals whose practices and purposes varied.
This case study allows researchers to establish details about ritual protocols at this site, including the intentional selection of adult animals rather than young, and the importance of fire evidenced by the presence of burned plant and animal remains. Casas del Turuñuelo also exhibits unique features compared to other sites, such as the high abundance of sacrificed horses. This study advances efforts to contextualize ritual animal sacrifices across Europe.
The authors add: ""This study highlights the role of mass animal sacrifices in the context of Iron Age European societies. Zooarchaeological, taphonomic and microstratigraphic investigations shed light on animal sacrifice practices and the Tartessian ritual behavior at the Iron Age site of Casas del Turuñuelo (Badajoz, Spain).""

The rites took place towards the end of the 5th century BCE when both the building (intentionally destroyed) and the sacrificed animals were intentionally buried under a tumulus 90 m in diameter and 6 m high. The main objective of the zooarchaeological and microstratigraphic analyses was to determine the phasing of the sacrificial depositions. Evidence gathered from taphonomic assessments and a series of radiocarbon datings indicate that the sacrifices fall into three consecutive phases spanning several years. The findings of the zooarchaeological analyses clearly point to a selection of equid and cattle males. Adult equids predominate (MNI = 41) followed by adult and sub-adult cattle (MNI = 6). Pigs, in turn, are only represented by a few adults and sub-adult females (MNI = 4). Among the animals is a single dog of undetermined sex between 3 and 4 years of age. The fact that the animals are mostly adults discards the likelihood that they died from natural causes or an epidemic. In addition, the scenographic deposition of certain equids in pairs, as well as evidence of the burning of plant offerings, suggest an intentional ritualistic sacrifice. Nine of the initial depositions of Phase 1 in the SE quadrant were scattered and certain of their bones bear marks characteristic of both prolonged open air exposure and scavengers. Another 31 animals from Phases 1 and 2 are represented by almost complete, articulated skeletons, indicating they were promptly covered. Phase 3, by contrast, reveals both almost complete and partial animals bearing clear signs of processing for human consumption. This study thus sheds light on both the sequence of the animal sacrifices and the protocols linked to rites accompanied by the celebration of banquets. Certain features associated with the sealing of this building under a tumulus offer evidence of the decline of the Tartessian Culture. This study thus advances notions serving to contextualize ritual animal sacrifices in the framework of practice observed at other Iron Age sites in the Iberian Peninsula and elsewhere throughout Europe."

Modern hippos first dispersed in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene, according to a study published November 22, 2023 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Beniamino Mecozzi of the Sapienza University of Rome and colleagues.

Modern hippos, Hippopotamus amphibius, arose from African ancestors during the Quaternary, a time when hippos were widespread in Europe. However, the details of the modern species' origin and dispersal into Europe are unclear and highly debated. In this study, Mecozzi and colleagues provide new insights via analysis of a fossil hippo skull from the study area of Tor di Quinto in Rome.
The skull of Tor di Quinto, currently housed at the Earth Science University Museum of Sapienza University of Rome, is among the most complete hippo specimens known from Pleistocene Europe, but its significance has been unclear due to uncertainties about its age and where exactly it was originally excavated. Following restoration of the skull in 2021, researchers were able to analyze the composition of sediments found within the skull cavities, revealing a match to the local Valle Guilia Formation, indicating a geologic age for this skull between 560,000-460,000 years old. Cranial and dental morphologies also confirmed the identity of this skull as the modern species Hippopotamus amphibius.
This research reveals this skull to be the oldest known fossil of this modern hippo species in Europe. These results shed light on the history of hippos in Europe, reinforcing the hypothesis of an early dispersal during the Middle Pleistocene and bolstering broader understanding of the deep history of these large mammals. Hippos are highly influential species within modern and ancient ecosystems, and they are valuable indicators of past climate and environmental conditions.
The authors add: ""Restoring the mammal skeletons exposed at the University Museum of Earth Science, Terra, Sapienza University of Rome offers new data for old fossils. The multidisciplinary study of the skull from Cava Montanari (Roma) redefines the first dispersal of Hippopotamus amphibius in Europe.""

Despite being one of the most complete specimens of hippopotamuses of the European Pleistocene, the Tor di Quinto skull did not attract much research interest, due to long-standing uncertainties on its provenance. This work begun in 2021, when the skull was restored, within a large renovation project on the vertebrate exposed at the Earth Science University Museum of Sapienza University of Rome. Original sediments were found inside the cranial and mandible cavities during the restoration work, which were sampled for petrographic analyses. By combining a review of the old paleontological, archeological and geological literature published during the 19th and 20th century on the Rome basin and the correlation of these new sedimentological and petrographic information with the lithostratigraphic and synthemic units of the national geological cartography, we clarify that the Hippopotamus skull was most likely to have been collected from a quarry called Cava Montanari, from a formation dated between 560 and 460 ka. Morphological and biometric analyses clearly support an attribution of the Cava Montanari specimen to the extant species Hippopotamus amphibius. The reassessment of the stratigraphic and geological data on Cava Montanari implies that the studied specimen is the earliest confirmed occurrence of Hippopotamus amphibius in the European fossil record."

Recent research has shown that engravings in a cave in La Roche-Cotard (France), which has been sealed for thousands of years, were actually made by Neanderthals. This research was performed by Basel archaeologist Dorota Wojtczak together with a team of researchers from France and Denmark, whose findings reveal that the Neanderthals were in fact the first humans with an appreciation of art.

When the French archaeologist Jean-Claude Marquet entered the La Roche-Cotard cave in the Loire Valley for the first time back in 1974, he suspected that the fine lines on the wall could be of human origin. He also found scrapers and other retouched pieces known as Mousterian stone artifacts that suggested the cave had been used by Neanderthals. Were the marks on the wall evidence of early Neanderthal artistic activity?
Posing this question raised the possibility of breaking with the consensus of the time, which largely assumed that Homo neanderthalensis lacked any higher cognitive abilities. Fearing he would be unable to provide sufficient scientific evidence to prove his hypothesis, Marquet left the cave untouched for almost 40 years.
Marks on the wall produced by human hands
Together with an international team, he made another attempt in 2016. This time he was accompanied by Dr. Dorota Wojtczak from Integrative Prehistoric and Archaeological Science (IPAS) at the Department of Environmental Sciences of the University of Basel, who specializes in archaeological use-wear analysis. ""Our task was to use modern methods to prove the human origin of these wall engravings,"" explains Wojtczak in her office at IPAS. The researchers recently published their findings in the journal PLoS ONE.
First with photos and drawings and later with a 3D scanner, the marks in the tuff rock of the cave wall were meticulously recorded. In her laboratory in Basel, Wojtczak compared these samples from the cave with tuff she had worked on experimentally with wood, bone and stone tools, as well as with her hands. ""This research clearly showed that the cave marks were not made with tools, but by scratching with human fingers,"" says Wojtczak.
Cave sealed for over 50,000 years
At the same time, examination of cave sediment by researchers from Denmark showed that the cave must have been sealed off by mud residues from the Loire and soil sediments for over 50,000 years before being rediscovered. This makes the La Roche-Cotard cave system a very special location -- a veritable ""time capsule."" ""At this time, 50,000 years ago, there were no modern humans in Europe, only Neanderthals,"" says Wojtczak. The wall marks and artifacts can therefore only come from these early humans.

While the clear geometric shapes with parallel and triangular lines suggest that these marks were not scribbled on the wall by chance, the researcher does not know what they represent. ""But they could only have been made by someone who proceeded with planning and understanding,"" she says. And whether it was ""art"" as such, or a form of recording-keeping, is a matter of interpretation.
La Roche-Cotard promises further findings
The cave holds many other archaeological secrets. Jean-Claude Marquet also found an object that resembles the face of a human or animal back in 1976, and Wojtczak's use-wear analysis suggests that this object is also man-made. Another object from the cave appears to be a small oil lamp. ""Specialists are currently investigating whether the object bears any pigments or soot substances that could help to identify the type of fuel used at the time,"" explains Wojtczak.
The chamber of La Roche-Cotard that has been explored so far is just one part of an entire cave system. The researcher hopes to gain further insight into the Neanderthals' activities, particularly from Chamber 4, which is still largely covered by sediment. Wojtczak is convinced that every investigation will help to further the dismantle traditional consensus of Neanderthals as mentally inferior humans, and reinforce the perception of them as more like the cousins of modern humans. ""They could speak, and probably even sang,"" she adds, grinning.
Dorota Wojtczak will continue her research into Neanderthal life in La Roche-Cotard together with her students from the Prehistory and Archaeological Science degree program.

Following human occupation, the cave was completely sealed by cold-period sediments, which prevented access until its discovery in the 19thcentury and first excavation in the early 20thcentury. The timing of the closure of the cave is based on 50 optically stimulated luminescence ages derived from sediment collected inside and from around the cave. The anthropogenic origin of the spatially-structured, non-figurative marks found within the cave is confirmed using taphonomic, traceological and experimental evidence. Cave closure occurred significantly before the regional arrival ofH.sapiens, and all artefacts from within the cave are typical Mousterian lithics; in Western Europe these are uniquely attributed toH.neanderthalensis. We conclude that the LRC engravings are unambiguous examples of Neanderthal abstract design."

Scientists from the Natural History Museum of Utah have taken a deep dive into the not-so-distant past thanks to a friendly tip from Utah's caving community. In a paper published this week by the Journal of Mammalogy, five scientists from the Natural History Museum of Utah (NHMU) and colleagues from Utah's caving community have published the first research from their collaborative field work effort deep in Utah's caves.

The journal's feature article reveals why caves make such compelling research archives; what was uncovered in Boomerang Cave in northern Utah; why skeletal remains provide new access to hard-to-get data from the recent past; and offers a new zoological baseline for mammalian changes in an alpine community.
""To understand the impacts of climate on alpine ecosystems, we record current mammal species -- mostly through trapping. But that method doesn't tell us anything about the mammalian diversity in the recent past,"" said Kaedan O'Brien, lead author and anthropology PhD candidate at the University of Utah. ""So not a lot of study has been done on past alpine ecosystems because they are harder to get to, and when you do there is a slim chance of finding older skeletal remains intact.""
In NHMU Chief Curator and paleoecologist Dr. Tyler Faith's words, ""We want to know what animals were there in the 1800s, but that's nearly impossible in the absence of historical records. How do we document the recent past without a time machine?"" An out-of-the-blue email from local caver and study co-author Eric Richards offered an unexpected method of time travel: repelling hundreds of feet down into Utah's caves to find what may have fallen in -- and when.
In early 2019, Richards emailed NHMU Curator of Paleontology Dr. Randy Irmis to ask if he or the museum had any interest in the animal bones that he'd been finding on Utah cave adventures, and he sent photographs. Irmis replied right away, including colleague Dr. Tyler Faith and O'Brien, a PhD student in Faith's lab. The group met, hit it off, and after a couple of trial outings for equipment training, Faith and Irmis were lowering themselves into caves to collect bones of by-gone animals.
""To be clear, this project would have never happened without the cavers reaching out to us, and investing time, and training with us. Eric and his wife Fumiko literally 'showed us the ropes.'"" said Faith. ""I hope people realize that research isn't just done by scientists who work at the museum, it can be public collaboration -- in this case with trained experts (do not try this at home).""
After Faith obtained a research permit from the U.S. Forest Service in September 2019, Richards took the team to Boomerang Cave in the Bear River Range where they collected specimens for lab analysis at the museum. O'Brien managed the lion's share of that work, upon which the paper is based.

""Identifying skeletal remains is painstaking work, because you just go bone by bone, sorting by size and element, and then comparing them with regional museum voucher specimens,"" said O'Brien. But the result is exciting.
Using radiocarbon dating, fossils found in Boomerang Cave were shown to span the past 3,000 years, with the bulk from the last 1000 years or so. Comparison of these fossils to museum records and present-day mammals collected by co-authors and NHMU zoologists, Dr. Eric Rickart and Katrina Derieg, showed that the cave provided a faithful reflection of mammal diversity in the area. Perhaps most exciting is that the fossils also revealed the presence of species unknown to the region, like Merriam's shrew. The full list of fossils is in the current Journal of Mammalogy, along with more on why this research matters.
""Our work highlights the value of collecting skeletal remains from caves as a convenient and accurate method for understanding the mammal communities"" said Irmis. ""Caves help us create comprehensive and long-term records and better understand how animals have changed in the recent past.""
Faith, Irmis, and O'Brien credit the ongoing success of this research to the curiosity and generosity of Utah's caving community.

We describe a Holocene paleontological assemblage from Boomerang Cave in the Bear River Range of Cache County, northern Utah, United States, at an elevation of 2,231 m, and at the boundary between the Great Basin and Rocky Mountain biogeographic provinces. We analyzed 1,228 surface-collected specimens from six areas within the cave, and identified a minimum of 22 nonoverlapping mammalian taxa, comprising all size classes present in the region. Compared to museum records for mammals from the Bear River Range and individuals trapped or observed in the vicinity of the cave, specimen-based rarefaction demonstrates that our assemblage captures most of the mammalian diversity expected in the area. This is particularly apparent for carnivorans and soricids, which are particularly well-represented in the Boomerang Cave assemblage, with the former clade represented by at least nine taxa. This high level of diversity can be attributed to the relatively random nature of natural trap cave deposition, reducing accumulation biases due to size or diet. We also record the first occurrence of Merriam’s Shrew (Sorex merriami) from the Bear River Range. Our analysis does not indicate any mammalian changes between late Holocene and present-day communities, but these data establish a new zoological baseline for an alpine community at the interface between two key biogeographic provinces in western North America. Our work highlights the value of collecting skeletal remains from cave assemblages as a convenient and fast method for censusing terrestrial mammalian communities."

Ten newly discovered species of trilobites, hidden for 490 million years in a little-studied part of Thailand, could be the missing pieces in an intricate puzzle of ancient world geography.

Trilobites are extinct sea creatures with half-moon-shaped heads that breathed through their legs. A 100-page monograph in the British journal offers great detail about the new species, including one named in honor of Thai Royal Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.
The trilobite fossils were trapped between layers of petrified ash in sandstone, the product of old volcanic eruptions that settled on the sea floor and formed a green layer called a tuff. Unlike some other kinds of rocks or sediment, tuffs contain crystals of zircon -- a mineral that formed during an eruption and are, as the name of the rock layer containing them suggests, tough.
Zircon is chemically stable as well as heat and weather resistant. It is hard as steel and persists when minerals in other kinds of rocks erode. Inside these resilient zircon crystals, individual atoms of uranium gradually decay and transform into atoms of lead.
""We can use radio isotope techniques to date when the zircon formed and thus find the age of the eruption, as well as the fossil,"" said Nigel Hughes, monograph co-author and UC Riverside geology professor.
It is rare to find tuffs from this particular period of time, the late Cambrian period, between 497 and 485 million years ago. ""Not many places around the world have this. It is one of the worst dated intervals of time in Earth's history,"" Hughes said.
""The tuffs will allow us to not only determine the age of the fossils we found in Thailand, but to better understand parts of the world like China, Australia, and even North America where similar fossils have been found in rocks that cannot be dated,"" said Shelly Wernette, former Hughes lab geologist now at Texas State University, and first author of the monograph.

The fossils were uncovered on the coast of an island called Ko Tarutao. It is about 40 minutes southwest from the mainland via high speed boat and is part of an UNESCO geopark site that has encouraged international teams of scientists to work in this area.
For Wernette, the most interesting discovery was 12 types of trilobites that have been seen in other parts of the world, but never in Thailand before. ""We can now connect Thailand to parts of Australia, a really exciting discovery.""
During the trilobites' lifetime, this region was on the outer margins of Gondwanaland, an ancient supercontinent that included Africa, India, Australia, South America, and Antarctica.
""Because continents shift over time, part of our job has been to work out where this region of Thailand was in relation to the rest of Gondwanaland,"" Hughes said. ""It's a moving, shape shifting, 3D jigsaw puzzle we're trying to put together. This discovery will help us do that.""
For example, take the species named for Royal Princess Sirindhorn. The species was named in tribute to the princess for her steadfast dedication to developing the sciences in Thailand. ""I also thought this species had a regal quality. It has a broad headdress and clean sweeping lines,"" Wernette said.
If researchers can get a date from the tuffs containing her namesake species, Tsinania sirindhornae, and determine when they lived, they will be able to say that closely related species of Tsinania found in northern and southern China are roughly the same age.
Ultimately, the researchers feel that the pictures of the ancient world hidden in the fossils they found contain invaluable information for the present day.
""What we have here is a chronicle of evolutionary change accompanied by extinctions. The Earth has written this record for us, and we're fortunate to have it,"" Hughes said. ""The more we learn from it the better prepared we are for the challenges we're engineering on the planet for ourselves today.""

LUCA, the 'last universal common ancestor' of all living organisms, lived 4.32 to at most 4.52 billion years ago. This is indicated by a study from NIOZ biologists Tara Mahendrarajah and senior author Anja Spang, with collaborating partners from Universities in Bristol, Hungary and Tokyo, that was published today in Nature Communications. What LUCA looked like is unknown, but it must have been a cell with among others ribosomal proteins and an ATP synthase. ""These proteins are shared by all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes such as plants and animals,"" Spang said. Using a new molecular dating approach, the researchers were able to more accurately estimate the moment when LUCA split into bacteria and archaea, as well as when eukaryotes emerged.

Dating the root
This new dating of the primordial form of all life is not dramatically different from previous estimates. ""Dating gets increasingly uncertain towards the root of the tree of life,"" co-corresponding author Tom Williams of the University of Bristol explains. One of the real surprises of this research by Mahendrarajah and colleagues are further up the tree of life. ""Archaea are often called ancient bacteria,"" says Spang. ""That would suggest that they stem from an ancestor that is older than the one of today's bacteria. But with this improved dating approach, we see that the ancestor of all current archaea lived between 3.37 and 3.95 billion years ago . This makes the last common ancestor of known archaea younger than the one of all bacteria, which lived between 4.05 and 4.49 billion years back. This suggests that earlier archaea either died out, or they live somewhere hidden on Earth where we have not found them yet,"" Spang hypothesizes.
We are fusions
The eukaryotes, meaning cells with a nucleus, such as all plants and animals, had their last common ancestor between 1.84 to 1.93 billion years back. Tara Mahendrarajah explains: ""If you imagine all life on earth as a family tree, LUCA is at the base and at some point, the trunk splits into a bacterial and an archaeal branch. But eukaryotes are not a separate branch on this tree of life, but rather a fusion of two branches that came out of the bacterial and the archaeal branches. We have a bit of both in us.""
Understanding natural history
""Our new estimates for the age of the archaeal and bacterial ancestors of eukaryotes will help to improve our models on eukaryotic origins,"" Edmund Moody of the Universit of Bristol adds. ""This new way of viewing the tree of life helps us track how cells have evolved over time on Earth. It also gives us a foundation to figure out what those early microbes did in their old environments and how their evolution is linked to natural history.""

The ATP synthase complex is thought to have originated prior to the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) and analyses of ATP synthase genes, together with ribosomes, have played a key role in inferring and rooting the tree of life. We reconstruct the evolutionary history of ATP synthases using an expanded taxon sampling set and develop a phylogenetic cross-bracing approach, constraining equivalent speciation nodes to be contemporaneous, based on the phylogenetic imprint of endosymbioses and ancient gene duplications. This approach results in a highly resolved, dated species tree and establishes an absolute timeline for ATP synthase evolution. Our analyses show that the divergence of ATP synthase into F- and A/V-type lineages was a very early event in cellular evolution dating back to more than 4 Ga, potentially predating the diversification of Archaea and Bacteria. Our cross-braced, dated tree of life also provides insight into more recent evolutionary transitions including eukaryogenesis, showing that the eukaryotic nuclear and mitochondrial lineages diverged from their closest archaeal (2.67-2.19 Ga) and bacterial (2.58-2.12 Ga) relatives at approximately the same time, with a slightly longer nuclear stem-lineage."

When Cara Ocobock was a young child, she often wondered at the images in movies, books, comics and cartoons portraying prehistoric men and women as such: ""man the hunter"" with spear in hand, accompanied by ""woman the gatherer"" with a baby strapped to her back and a basket of crop seeds in hand.

""This was what everyone was used to seeing,"" Ocobock said. ""This was the assumption that we've all just had in our minds and that was carried through in our museums of natural history.""
Many years later, Ocobock, an assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology and director of the Human Energetics Laboratory at the University of Notre Dame, found herself as a human biologist studying physiology and prehistoric evidence and discovering that many of these conceptions about early women and men weren't quite accurate. The accepted reconstruction of human evolution assumed males were biologically superior, but that interpretation wasn't telling the whole story.
Relying on both physiological and archaeological evidence, Ocobock and her research partner, Sarah Lacy, an anthropologist with expertise in biological archaeology at the University of Delaware, recently published two studies simultaneously in the journal American Anthropologist. Their joint research, coming from these two angles, found that not only did prehistoric women engage in the practice of hunting, but their female anatomy and biology would have made them intrinsically better suited for it.
Of her and her co-author's dual-pronged research, which was the cover story for the November issue of Scientific American, Ocobock said, ""Rather than viewing it as a way of erasing or rewriting history, our studies are trying to correct the history that erased women from it.""
Female physiology and estrogen, the 'unsung hero of life'
In their physiological study, the two researchers explained that prehistoric females were quite capable of performing the arduous physical task of hunting prey and were likely able to hunt successfully over prolonged periods of time. From a metabolic standpoint, Ocobock explained, the female body is better suited for endurance activity, ""which would have been critical in early hunting because they would have had to run the animals down into exhaustion before actually going in for the kill.""
Two huge contributors to that enhanced metabolism are hormones -- in this case, estrogen and adiponectin, which are typically present in higher quantities in female bodies than in male. These two hormones play a critical role in enabling the female body to modulate glucose and fat, a function that is key in athletic performance.

Estrogen, in particular, helps regulate fat metabolism by encouraging the body to use its stored fat for energy before using up its carbohydrate stores. ""Since fat contains more calories than carbs do, it's a longer, slower burn,"" Ocobock explained, ""which means that the same sustained energy can keep you going longer and can delay fatigue.""
Estrogen also protects the body's cells from damage during heat exposure due to extreme physical activity. ""Estrogen is really the unsung hero of life, in my mind,"" Ocobock said. ""It is so important for cardiovascular and metabolic health, brain development and injury recovery.""
Adiponectin also amplifies fat metabolism while sparing carbohydrate and/or protein metabolism, allowing the body to stay the course during extended periods, especially over great distances. In this way, adiponectin is able to protect the muscles from breaking down and keeps them in better condition for sustained exercise, Ocobock explained.
The female body structure itself is another element Ocobock and Lacy found to be of advantage in terms of endurance and effectiveness for prehistoric hunters. ""With the typically wider hip structure of the female, they are able to rotate their hips, lengthening their steps,"" Ocobock detailed. ""The longer steps you can take, the 'cheaper' they are metabolically, and the farther you can get, faster.
""When you look at human physiology this way, you can think of women as the marathon runners versus men as the powerlifters.""
Archaeology tells more of the story of 'woman the hunter'
Several archaeological findings indicate prehistoric women not only shared in the resulting injuries of the dangerous business of close-contact hunting, but that it was an activity held in high esteem and valued by them. ""We have constructed Neandertal hunting as an up-close-and-personal style of hunting,"" Ocobock said, ""meaning that hunters would often have to get up underneath their prey in order to kill them. As such, we find that both males and females have the same resulting injuries when we look at their fossil records.""

Ocobock described those traumatic injuries as being similar to those received by modern-day rodeo clowns -- injuries to the head and chest where they were kicked by the animal, or to the limbs where they were bitten or received a fracture. ""We find these patterns and rates of wear and tear equally in both women and men,"" she said. ""So they were both participating in ambush-style hunting of large game animals.""
Second, Ocobock said, there is evidence of early female hunters in the Holocene period in Peru where females were buried with hunting weapons. ""You don't often get buried with something unless it was important to you or was something that you used frequently in your life.
""Furthermore, we have no reason to believe that prehistoric women abandoned their hunting while pregnant, breastfeeding or carrying children,"" Ocobock added, ""nor do we see in the deep past any indication that a strict sexual division of labor existed.""
The bottom line, Ocobock noted, was that ""hunting belonged to everyone, not just to males,"" especially in prehistoric societies where survival was an all-hands-on-deck activity. ""There weren't enough people living in groups to be specialized in different tasks. Everyone had to be a generalist to survive.""
Fighting bias
""This revelation is especially important in the current political moment of our society where sex and gender are in a spotlight,"" Ocobock said. ""And I want people to be able to change these ideas of female physical inferiority that have been around for so long.""
When talking about reconstructing the past in order to better understand it -- and to conduct ""good science"" -- Ocobock said scientists have to be extremely careful about how modern-day bias can seep into one's interpretations of the past. She cautioned that researchers have to be aware of their own biases and make sure they are asking the proper questions so the questions don't lead them down the road of looking for what it is they want to see.
""We have to change the biases we bring to the table, or at least to give pause before we assign those biases. And in a broader sense, you cannot outrightly assume somebody's abilities based on whatever sex or gender you have assigned by looking at them,"" Ocobock concluded.

Long considered myth, freakishly large rogue waves are very real and can split apart ships and even damage oil rigs. Using 700 years' worth of wave data from more than a billion waves, scientists at the University of Copenhagen and University of Victoria have used artificial intelligence to find a formula for how to predict the occurrence of these maritime monsters. The new knowledge can make shipping safer.

Stories about monster waves, called rogue waves, have been the lore of sailors for centuries. But when a 26-metre-high rogue wave slammed into the Norwegian oil platform Draupner in 1995, digital instruments were there to capture and measure the North Sea monster. It was the first time that a rogue had been measured and provided scientific evidence that abnormal ocean waves really do exist.
Since then, these extreme waves have been the subject of much study. And now, researchers from the University of Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute have used AI methods to discover a mathematical model that provides a recipe for how -- and not least when -- rogue waves can occur.
With the help of enormous amounts of big data about ocean movements, researchers can predict the likelihood of being struck by a monster wave at sea at any given time.
""Basically, it is just very bad luck when one of these giant waves hits. They are caused by a combination of many factors that, until now, have not been combined into a single risk estimate. In the study, we mapped the causal variables that create rogue waves and used artificial intelligence to gather them in a model which can calculate the probability of rogue wave formation,"" says Dion Häfner.
Häfner is a former PhD student at the Niels Bohr Institute and first author of the scientific study, which has just been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
Rogue waves happen every day
In their model, the researchers combined available data on ocean movements and the sea state, as well as water depths and bathymetric information. Most importantly, wave data was collected from buoys in 158 different locations around US coasts and overseas territories that collect data 24 hours a day. When combined, this data -- from more than a billion waves -- contains 700 years' worth of wave height and sea state information.

The researchers analyzed the many types of data to find the causes of rogue waves, defined as being waves that are at least twice as high as the surrounding waves -- including extreme rogue waves that can be over 20 meters high. With machine learning, they transformed it all into an algorithm that was then applied to their dataset.
""Our analysis demonstrates that abnormal waves occur all the time. In fact, we registered 100,000 waves in our dataset that can be defined as rogue waves. This is equivalent around 1 monster wave occurring every day at any random location in the ocean. However, they aren't all monster waves of extreme size,"" explains Johannes Gemmrich, the study's second author.
Artificial intelligence as a scientist
In the study, the researchers were helped by artificial intelligence. They used several AI methods, including symbolic regression which gives an equation as output, rather than just returning a single prediction as traditional AI methods do.
By examining more than 1 billion waves, the researchers' algorithm has analyzed its own way into finding the causes of rogue waves and condensed it into equation that describes the recipe for a rogue wave. The AI learns the causality of the problem and communicates that causality to humans in the form of an equation that researchers can analyze and incorporate into their future research.
""Over decades, Tycho Brahe collected astronomical observations from which Kepler, with lots of trial and error, was able to extract Kepler's Laws. Dion used machines to do with waves what Kepler did with planets. For me, it is still shocking that something like this is possible,"" says Markus Jochum.

Phenomenon known since the 1700s 
The new study also breaks with the common perception of what causes rogue waves. Until now, it was believed that the most common cause of a rogue wave was when one wave briefly combined with another and stole its energy, causing one big wave to move on.
However, the researchers establish that the most dominant factor in the materialization of these freak waves is what is known as ""linear superposition."" The phenomenon, known about since the 1700s, occurs when two wave systems cross over each other and reinforce one another for a brief period of time.
""If two wave systems meet at sea in a way that increases the chance to generate high crests followed by deep troughs, the risk of extremely large waves arises. This is knowledge that has been around for 300 years and which we are now supporting with data,"" says Dion Häfner.
Safer shipping
The researchers' algorithm is good news for the shipping industry, which at any given time has roughly 50,000 cargo ships sailing around the planet. Indeed, with the help of the algorithm, it will be possible to predict when this ""perfect"" combination of factors is present to elevate the risk of a monster wave that could pose a danger for anyone at sea.
""As shipping companies plan their routes well in advance, they can use our algorithm to get a risk assessment of whether there is a chance of encountering dangerous rogue waves along the way. Based on this, they can choose alternative routes,"" says Dion Häfner.
Both the algorithm and research are publicly available, as are the weather and wave data deployed by the researchers. Therefore, Dion Häfner says that interested parties, such as public authorities and weather services, can easily begin calculating the probability of rogue waves. And unlike many other models created using artificial intelligence, all of the intermediate calculations in the researchers' algorithm are transparent.
""AI and machine learning are typically black boxes that don't increase human understanding. But in this study, Dion used AI methods to transform an enormous database of wave observations into a new equation for the probability of rogue waves, which can be easily understood by people and related to the laws of physics,"" concludes Professor Markus Jochum, Dion's thesis supervisor and co-author.

In addition to being accurate, scientific theories must also be causally consistent with the underlying physical process and allow for human analysis, reasoning, and manipulation to advance the field. In this paper, we present a case study on discovering a symbolic model for oceanic rogue waves from data using causal analysis, deep learning, parsimony-guided model selection, and symbolic regression. We train an artificial neural network on causal features from an extensive dataset of observations from wave buoys, while selecting for predictive performance and causal invariance. We apply symbolic regression to distill this black-box model into a mathematical equation that retains the neural network’s predictive capabilities, while allowing for interpretation in the context of existing wave theory. The resulting model reproduces known behavior, generates well-calibrated probabilities, and achieves better predictive scores on unseen data than current theory. This showcases how machine learning can facilitate inductive scientific discovery and paves the way for more accurate rogue wave forecasting."

Using historical records from around Australia, an international team of researchers have put forward the most accurate prediction to date of past Antarctic ice sheet melt, providing a more realistic forecast of future sea level rise.

The Antarctic ice sheet is the largest block of ice on earth, containing over 30 million cubic kilometers of water.
Hence, its melting could have a devastating impact on future sea levels. To find out just how big that impact might be, the research team, including Dr Mark Hoggard from The Australian National University, turned to the past.
""If we want to know what is going to happen in the next 100 years, we need to have an accurate model for how ice sheets respond to climate change,"" Dr Hoggard said.
""Previous forecasts of the Antarctic contribution to global mean sea level rise were anywhere between 20 and 52cm by 2100. But by getting a better idea of sea levels during the Mid-Pliocene era, our study reduces this estimate to between 5 and 9cm.
""The Mid-Pliocene period 3 million years ago is considered the best equivalent to conditions expected this coming century in terms of CO2 levels and temperature.""
Dr Hoggard said accurately determining sea level during this period can help reveal how the Antarctic ice sheet behaved in the past and therefore how it might behave in the future.

To determine the historic sea level, researchers first looked at the geological record of Australia to find fossilised corals and other sea-level markers that indicate how high the shoreline used to be.
""This is not a perfect method as fossil markers are not only affected by the movement of the sea, but also the movement of the land,"" Dr Hoggard said.
Over millions of years, Earth's tectonic plates move up and down in a process called dynamic topography.
""If you stand on the shoreline of Australia today and see that our sea level is rising, it could be one of two things. It could be sea level genuinely rising, or it could be the land you're standing on subsiding,"" Dr Hoggard said.
""For the first time, we have corrected for these up and down movements across a whole continent, so we can see where the sea level markers really sit.""
Previous estimates had sea level during the Mid-Pliocene somewhere between six and 60 meters above current sea level in Australia. Now, it can be more accurately pinned at 16 meters, with the Antarctic ice sheet likely contributing 9.8 meters in height.

Dr Hoggard credited the accuracy of these predictions to significant advances in science over the past 10 years.
""Thanks to better models, improvements in computational power and a greater understanding of the geological processes, our ability to map the movement of tectonic plates over the mantle has been revolutionised,"" he said.
""Right now, this is probably the best reconstruction we've got.""
Reducing this uncertainty will allow for more accurate modelling of future sea level rise.
While a lower estimated contribution by the Antarctic ice sheet is good news, the researchers point out there is still plenty of work to be done.
""If you live in a Pacific Island nation like Tuvalu where the highest point of elevation is only 4.6 meters, small changes in the baseline sea level can have devastating impacts when disaster events like cyclones or storm surges hit,"" Dr Hoggard said.
""Ensuring we have more accurate models can help improve policy, especially when looking at coastal and low-lying communities which can be impacted by just centimeters of sea level change.""

Mid-Pliocene sea level estimates therefore provide important constraints on projections of future ice sheet behavior and sea level change but differ by tens of meters due to local distortion of paleoshorelines caused by mantle dynamics. We combine an Australian sea level marker compilation with geodynamic simulations and probabilistic inversions to quantify and remove these post-Pliocene vertical motions at continental scale. Dynamic topography accounts for most of the observed sea level marker deflection, and correcting for this effect and glacial isostatic adjustment yields a Mid-Pliocene global mean sea level of +16.0 (+10.4 to +21.5) m (50th/16th to 84th percentiles). Recalibration of recent high-end sea level projections using this revised estimate implies a more stable Antarctic Ice Sheet under future warming scenarios, consistent with midrange forecasts of sea level rise that do not incorporate a marine ice cliff instability."

Geochemist Alexandra Phillips has sulfur on her mind. The yellow element is a vital macronutrient, and she's trying to understand how it cycles through the environment. Specifically, she's curious about the sulfur cycle in Earth's ancient ocean, some 3 billion years ago.

Fortunately, the nutrient-poor waters of Lake Superior offer a welcome glimpse into the past. ""It's really hard to look back billions of years,"" said Phillips, a former postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Barbara and University of Minnesota, Duluth. ""So this is a great window."" She and her co-authors discovered a new type of sulfur cycle in the lake. Their findings, published in Limnology and Oceanography, focus attention on the role organic sulfur compounds play in this biogeochemical cycle.
The sulfate ion (SO4) is the most common form of sulfur in the environment, and a major component of seawater. In the bottoms of oceans and lakes, where oxygen becomes unavailable, some microbes make their living by turning sulfate into hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The fate of this hydrogen sulfide is complex; it can be consumed quickly by microorganisms during respiration, or it can be retained in sediments for millions of years. Converting sulfate into hydrogen sulfide is a time-honored profession; genomic evidence suggests microbes have been doing it for at least 3 billion years.
But scientists believe sulfate didn't become abundant until around 2.7 to 2.4 billion years ago, when photosynthetic activity of newly evolved cyanobacteria began pumping massive amounts of oxygen into the ocean and atmosphere. So where were these ancient microbes getting their sulfate?
Alexandra Phillips is a marine and climate scientist with expertise in oceanography, geochemistry, and geobiology. Her research focuses on organic sulfur in oceans and lakes as well as how social media can display diverse role models for women in STEM. Phillips also serves as a science communicator and policy officer.
Mulling over this quandary, Phillips turned her attention toward organic sulfur, molecules in which sulfur is bound to a carbon compound. These include sulfo-lipids, and sulfur amino acids. In the modern ocean, sulfate is almost a million times more abundant than organic sulfur. ""But in a system where there's not very much sulfate, all of a sudden organic sulfur matters a lot more,"" she said.
""For a long time, our thinking was dominated by what we could learn from modern oceans, which are sulfate-rich,"" said senior author Sergei Katsev, a professor at University of Minnesota's Large Lakes Observatory. Katsev served as the senior scientist of the National Science Foundation-funded project. ""Understanding early Earth, however, requires looking at processes that emerge when sulfate is scarce, and this is where organic sulfur can change the whole paradigm.""
It just so happens that Lake Superior has very little sulfate, nearly a thousand times less than the modern ocean. ""In terms of sulfate, Lake Superior looks a lot closer to the ocean billions of years ago and may help us understand processes we can't go back in time to observe directly,"" Phillips said. The early oceans had very little sulfate because there was much less free oxygen available to form SO4.

The great lake serves as an analog for the ancient ocean, enabling Phillips to see how the sulfur cycle may have been playing out back then under similar chemistries. She had three questions in mind: If sulfate reduction is happening, which microbes are responsible? If organic sulfur is fueling this process, what types of compounds do microbes prefer? And, what happens to the hydrogen sulfide that's produced?Phillips and her collaborators headed out to Lake Superior to trace organic sulfur from source to sink. The team took water and sediment samples back to the lab for analysis from two sites: one with plentiful oxygen in the sediment and one without. Sulfate reduction usually occurs in anoxic parts of the environment. Oxygen is a great resource, so organisms prefer to use oxygen instead of sulfate when they can. The team used shotgun metagenomics to look for microbes with genes involved in sulfate reduction. And they found plenty, precisely in the layer where sulfate levels peaked in the sediment. In all, they identified eight sulfate-reducing taxa.
The researchers then set off to determine what variety of organic sulfur the microbes preferred. They gave different forms of organic sulfur to separate microbial communities and observed the results. The authors found the microbes produced most of their sulfate from sulfo-lipids, rather than the sulfur amino acids. Although this process takes some energy, it's much less than the microbes can get from the subsequent reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide.
Not only were the sulfo-lipids preferred for this process, they were also more abundant in the sediment. Sulfo-lipids are produced by other microbial communities, and drift to the lake bottom when they die.
With the ""who"" and the ""how"" answered, Phillips turned her attention to the fate of the hydrogen sulfide. In the modern ocean, hydrogen sulfide can react with iron to form pyrite. But it can also react with organic molecules, producing organic sulfur compounds. ""And we found that there is a ton of organic matter sulfurization in the lake, which is really surprising to us,"" she said. ""Not only is organic sulfur fueling the sulfur cycle as a source, but it's also an eventual sink for the hydrogen sulfide.""
This cycle -- from organic sulfur to sulfate to hydrogen sulfide and back -- is completely new to researchers. ""Scientists studying aquatic systems need to start thinking about organic sulfur as a central player,"" Phillips said. These compounds can drive the sulfur cycle in nutrient-poor environments like Lake Superior, or even the ancient ocean.
This process may also be important in systems with high sulfate. ""Organic sulfur cycling, like what we see in Lake Superior, is probably ubiquitous in marine and freshwater sediments. But in the ocean sulfate is so abundant that its behavior swamps out most of our signals,"" said senior author Morgan Raven, a biogeochemist at UC Santa Barbara. ""Working in low-sulfate Lake Superior lets us see how dynamic the sedimentary organic sulfur cycle really is."" Organic sulfur seems to serve as an energy source for microbial communities as well as preserve organic carbon and molecular fossils. Combined, these factors could help scientists understand the evolution of early sulfur-cycling microorganisms and their impact on Earth's chemistry.
Some of the earliest biochemical reactions likely involved sulfur, Phillips added. ""We're pretty sure that sulfur played an important role in really early metabolisms."" A better understanding of the sulfur cycle could provide insights on how early lifeforms harnessed this type of redox chemistry.

To better understand organic sulfur cycling in these systems, we followed organic sulfur in the sulfate‐poor (< 40 μM) iron‐rich (30–80 μM) sediments of Lake Superior from source to sink. We identified microbial populations with shotgun metagenomic sequencing and characterized geochemical species in porewater and solid phases. In anoxic sediments, we found an active sulfur cycle fueled primarily by oxidized organic sulfur. Sediment incubations indicated a microbial capacity to hydrolyze sulfonates, sulfate esters, and sulfonic acids to sulfate. Gene abundances for dissimilatory sulfate reduction (dsrAB) increased with depth and coincided with sulfide maxima. Despite these indicators of sulfide formation, sulfide concentrations remain low (< 40 nM) due to both pyritization and organic matter sulfurization. Immediately below the oxycline, pyrite accounted for 13% of total sedimentary sulfur. Both free and intact lipids in this same interval accumulated disulfides, indicating rapid sulfurization even at low concentrations of sulfide. Our investigation revealed a new model of sulfur cycling in a low‐sulfate environment that likely extends to other modern lakes and possibly the ancient ocean, with organic sulfur both fueling sulfate reduction and consuming the resultant sulfide."

New dates provide detailed insights into the timing of events in the ancient city of Gezer, according to a study published November 15, 2023 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Lyndelle Webster of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and colleagues.

Gezer is an ancient southern Levantine city, well known from Egyptian, Assyrian, and Biblical texts and associated with stories of power struggles and significant historical figures. It is also a rich archaeological site with abundant Bronze Age and Iron Age remains and with great potential for research into the daily lives of its denizens. Recent excavations at the site have uncovered a continuous stratigraphic sequence that allows for detailed dating and the establishment of an absolute chronology for events at the site.
In this study, Webster and colleagues obtained 35 radiocarbon dates on organic materials (mostly seeds) from seven distinct stratigraphic layers at Gezer. These dates range from the 13th to the 9th centuries, a time period that covers numerous significant changes in the city, including multiple destructive events, rebuilding episodes, and the fortification of the city. Some of these events have been proposed to be linked to certain stories from ancient texts.
This study provides a detailed dataset that can be used to test proposed correlations between the archaeological record and ancient texts. These dates suggest, for example, that the correlation of a certain destructive episode with the actions of the pharaoh Merneptah is plausible, while the proposed link between another such episode and the campaign of Hazael is not. Ultimately, this new dataset provides an independent source of absolute dates that will allow researchers to better understand the events at Gezer and to place them in a regional perspective.
The authors add: ""The development of a radiocarbon-based chronology at Tel Gezer -- a site with uniquely rich historical connections -- illustrates the crucial role radiocarbon dating can and must play in reconstructing individual site histories, resolving long-running debates and testing possible correlations between archaeological remains and written sources.""

Since the identity of Gezer with “Tell Jezer” is quite literally ‘set in stone’ by some dozen boundary inscriptions, along with impressive Bronze and Iron Age remains, research at this site provides a unique opportunity to compare text and archaeology, as well as bring to light the undocumented everyday lives of the city’s inhabitants.

This paper presents the first substantial radiocarbon dataset and Bayesian chronological analysis for Gezer spanning the last part of the Late Bronze Age (LBA; LB IIB) through Iron Age II.

The discovery of 27 avian footprints on the southern Australia coast -- dating back to the Early Cretaceous when Australia was still connected to Antarctica -- opens another window onto early avian evolution and possible migratory behavior.

PLOS ONE published the discovery of some of the oldest, positively identified bird tracks in the Southern Hemisphere, dated to between 120 million and 128 million years ago.
""Most of the bird tracks and body fossils dating as far back as the Early Cretaceous are from the Northern Hemisphere, particularly from Asia,"" says Anthony Martin, first author of the study and a professor in Emory University's Department of Environmental Sciences. ""Our discovery shows that there were many birds, and a variety of them, near the South Pole about 125 million years ago.""
Martin is a geologist and paleontologist focused primarily on ichnology -- the study of traces of life such as tracks, burrows, nests and tooth marks.
The international team of co-authors also includes researchers from Monash University and the Museums Victoria Research Institute in Australia; the Benemérita Normal School of Coahuila in Mexico and the Smithsonian Institution.
A possible migratory route
The 27 bird tracks vary in form and size and are among the largest known from the Early Cretaceous. They range from seven to 14 centimeters wide, which is similar to tracks of modern-day shorebirds, such as small herons and oystercatchers.

The tracks were found in the Wonthaggi Formation south of Melbourne. The rocky coastal strata mark where the ancient supercontinent Gondwana began to break up around 100 million years ago when Australia separated from Antarctica.
The polar environment at that time was a rift valley with braided rivers. Although the mean annual air temperature was higher during the Cretaceous than today, during the polar winters the ecosystem experienced deep, freezing temperatures and months of darkness.
The Wonthaggi avian tracks occurred on multiple stratigraphic levels, indicating a recurrent presence of a variety of birds. It also suggests seasonal formation of the tracks during polar summers, perhaps on a migratory route.
""The birds would likely have been stepping on soft sand or mud,"" Martin says. ""Then the tracks may have been buried by a gentle river flow that deposited more sand or mud on top of them.""
A scarcity of bird fossils
The Wonthaggi Formation is famous for its variety of polar dinosaur bones, although bird-fossil finds are extremely rare. The Cretaceous strata of the formation has yielded only one tiny bird bone -- a wishbone -- and a few feathers.

""Birds have such thin and tiny bones,"" Martin says. ""Think of the likelihood of a sparrow being preserved in the geologic record as opposed to an elephant.""
Birds are also lightweight and don't leave much of a foot impression, he adds.
Martin and colleagues discovered two 105-million-year-old bird tracks in Australia's Eumeralla Formation in 2013, making them the oldest from Australia at the time.

Co-author Melissa Lowery, a local volunteer fossil hunter, first spotted some of the tracks in the current discovery in 2020. Dubbed ""the doyenne of dinosaur discovery,"" Lowery has found hundreds of bones and more than 100 dinosaur footprints.
""Melissa is incredibly skilled at finding fossil tracks,"" Martin says. ""Some of these tracks are subtle even for me, and I have lots of experience and training.""
Most of the tracks were only exposed at low tide and some of them were encrusted by marine life such as algae, barnacles and mollusks.
Due to international travel restrictions in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic, Martin had to wait until 2022 before he could travel to the site to lead the analyses of the tracks.
He was joined in the field by co-authors Patricia Vickers-Rich, professor of paleontology at Monash University, and Thomas Rich, curator of vertebrate aleontology at Museums Victoria Research Institute. The couple have led a major effort since the 1970s to uncover fossils in the Australian state of Victoria and to interpret the biota of Gondwana.
Also assisting in the field analyses were co-authors Mike Hall, a geologist at Monash University, and Peter Swinkels, a taxidermist at Museums Victoria Research Institute and an expert at preserving specimens through moldings and casts.
The thinness of the toes relative to the track lengths, the wide angles between the toes and the thin sharp claws and rear toes on some of the tracks helped Martin to verify their avian identity.
Co-author Claudia Serrano-Brañas, a paleontologist at the Benemérita Normal School of Coahuila and the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, verified similarities between the Australian bird footprints and ancient bird footprints from other parts of the world.
Swinkels created resin casts of the Australian tracks that brought into greater relief some of the nuances of the impressions. The casts provide a tool for further study. They also serve to preserve the finds. The silty, sandstone beds containing the footprints are rapidly eroding under the coastal tides and waves.
""Seven of the tracks that Melissa found in 2020 are no longer there,"" Martin says. ""Some fossils, including tracks, are exposed only for a brief amount of time after being buried for millions of years. We humans have to rush in and document them before they disappear again.""

In the geological past, several groups of crocodiles evolved towards a morphology adapted to marine life. However, the extent of these adaptations and their evolutionary trajectories remained unknown. An exhaustive study of their morphology by a scientific team from the Evolution & Diversity Dynamics Lab (EDDyLab) at the University of Liège has now shed light on the evolutionary mechanisms at work, thanks to three-dimensional reconstructions.

Contrary to what its few current species might suggest, the crocodile group was highly diversified in the past, with herbivorous, arboreal, and even totally marine species. Thalattosuchians and dyrosaurs, two crocodile species, colonised the marine environment independently in the geological past. ""These two groups of crocodiles are also very interesting to study because they managed to survive major biological crises,"" explains Isaure Scavezzoni, a doctoral student at the Evolution & Diversity Dynamics Lab and principal author of the study. Thalattosuchians survived the Jurassic-Cretaceous transition (145 million years ago) and dyrosaurs the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous (66 million years ago)."" However, the extent and diversity of these animals' adaptations to marine life are still very poorly understood because their body anatomy has been relatively little studied. We do not know the evolutionary trajectories underlying these evolutionary successes. Are they similar or did these groups take different routes to marine life? Researchers at the University of Liège's EDDyLab have attempted to answer this question using 3D modelling.
""The scale of the task involved in answering these questions is immense,"" explains Valentin Fischer, palaeontologist and director of the EDDyLab. We have carried out hundreds of scans and high-definition 3D reconstructions of the limb, shoulder and pelvis bones of a wide range of species of thalattosuchians, dyrosaurs and even modern crocodiles."" These data enabled the team to analyse the evolutionary trajectories of these two species in order to detect possible convergences, i.e. cases of independent evolution of similar morphologies. To do this, several dozen reference points were placed on each bone; the resulting 3D coordinates were then compared between species and tested in a phylogenetic framework, i.e. taking into account the kinship links between the species analysed.
""Our results show that thalattosuchians and dyrosaurids differ greatly from each other in their adaptations and functional capacities, but that they also diverge greatly from present-day crocodiles,"" says Isaure Scavezzoni. This work reveals not only the (previously underestimated) potential of the fossil crocodile skeleton as a source of phylogenetic characters, but also that these groups differed profoundly from present-day crocodiles in the way they moved and swam. The incorporation of postcranial anatomy therefore seems crucial to fully assess the ecology, disparity, and relationships of crocodylomorphs.

Their postcrania remain globally undervalued in anatomical descriptions and diagnoses, shrouding the locomotive adaptations that possibly underpinned their radiations and longevity. We thoroughly surveyed the postcranial morphology of Dyrosauridea and Thalattosuchia, recreated their girdles in three‐dimensions using tens of high‐precisions 3D scans, and analysed their shape using geometric morphometrics. Dyrosauridea and Thalattosuchia have clearly distinct postcrania, even when found within similar environments, suggesting the existence of clade‐specific features limiting the strength of evolutionary convergence. Moreover, the range of postcranial morphologies evolved by dyrosaurids and thalattosuchians is large compared to extant crocodylians, making the latter unsatisfactory functional analogues for every group of extinct crocodylomorphs.

As the primary element of life on our planet, carbon is constantly journeying from living creatures down into the Earth's crust and back up into the atmosphere, but until recently, quantifying this journey was virtually impossible.

To help unravel the mystery of how the Earth cycles fossil carbon, Rice University's Mark Torres and collaborators studied the chemistry of a river system extending from the Peruvian Andes to the Amazon floodplains. Together with collaborators from five other institutions, Torres helped show that high rates of carbon breakdown persist from mountaintop to floodplain, as the carbon bound in rock that was once prehistoric ocean floor gets released into the atmosphere through erosion and weathering.
According to a study published in PNAS, the researchers used rhenium ⎯ a silvery-gray, heavy transition metal ⎯ as a proxy for carbon. Understanding the Earth's natural, pre-anthropogenic carbon cycle offers valuable insights into the planet's history and its response to current climate challenges.
""The purpose of this research was to quantify the rate at which Earth naturally releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and find out whether this process varies across different geographic locations,"" Torres said.
Traditionally, understanding this process has been challenging as it involves complex chemical reactions that transform rocks into gases like carbon dioxide, making it difficult to quantify.
""This research used a newly-developed technique pioneered by Robert Hilton and Mathieu Dellinger that relies on a trace element ⎯ rhenium ⎯ that's incorporated in fossil organic matter,"" Torres said. ""As plankton die and sink to the bottom of the ocean, that dead carbon becomes chemically reactive in a way that adds rhenium to it.""
Over vast periods of time, geological processes can cause the rock on the ocean floor to be thrust to the Earth's surface as mountain ranges and the ancient carbon locked in the rock gets slowly released in the atmosphere. As this happens, rhenium is left behind, which can be measured in water.

Unlike other elements in fossil carbon ⎯ such as nitrogen or phosphorus ⎯ which are taken up by plants or become part of other chemical or biological processes, rhenium is relatively inert, making it a good tool for gauging how much carbon gets released into the atmosphere from the Earth's crust.
""Organisms don't care about it ⎯ it's not a nutrient,"" Torres said. ""It just passively gets incorporated into rivers, where we can measure it. A good proxy is one that only responds to the process you're trying to study.
""You have to know a lot about rhenium as an element and its chemistry and the environment to be able to interpret it in this way. There is a lot of interpretive work that has had to come before these measurements that allows us to say that the only host for this element is the fossil carbon evaporated into the atmosphere.""
The Rio Madre de Dios basin was an ideal location for studying this question because it provided a natural gradient from the heights of one of the tallest mountain ranges down to the floodplains of the world's largest river by volume. Moreover, the rock types exposed at this site are carbon-rich shales, which Torres says is exactly what you would want to study in this case.
""I'm very excited about this tool,"" Torres said. ""Rice students have deployed this same method in our lab here, so now we can make this kind of measurement and apply it at other sites. In fact, as part of current research funded by the National Science Foundation, we are applying this technique in Southern California to learn how tectonics and climate influence the breakdown of fossil carbon.""
By grasping the slow processes that govern our planet's carbon cycle, scientists can build more accurate climate models and work toward more effective strategies of mitigating the impact of anthropogenic carbon emissions.
Torres is an assistant professor of Earth, environmental and planetary sciences at Rice. Hilton, a professor of sedimentary geology at the University of Oxford, and Dellinger, a researcher at Université Savoie Mont Blanc, are lead authors on the study.

High erosion rates in mountains have been shown to increase OC petro oxidation. However, these settings also export unweathered material that may continue to react in downstream floodplains. The relative importance of OC petro oxidation in mountains versus floodplains remains difficult to assess as disparate methods have been used in the different environments. Here, we investigate the sources and fluxes of rhenium (Re) in the Rio Madre de Dios to quantify OC petro oxidation from the Andes to the Amazon floodplain using a common approach. Dissolved rhenium concentrations (n = 131) range from 0.01 to 63 pmol L −1 and vary depending on lithology and geomorphic setting. We find that >75% of the dissolved Re derives from OC petro oxidation and that this proportion increases downstream. We estimate that in the Andes, OC petro oxidation releases 11.2 +4.5 / −2.8 tC km −2 y −1 of CO 2 , which corresponds to ~41% of the total OC petro denudation (sum of oxidized and solid OC petro ). A Re mass balance across the Rio Madre de Dios shows that 46% of OC petro oxidation takes place in the Andes, 14% in the foreland-lowlands, and 40% in the Andean-fed floodplains. This doubling of OC petro oxidation flux downstream of the Andes demonstrates that, when present, floodplains can greatly increase OC petro oxidation and CO 2 release."

Textbooks on biology and forestry make it clear that large parts of Europe would naturally be covered by dense forests.

The textbook narrative is that our ancestors felled the forests, drained the swamps and cultivated the heathland. In other words, they created the varied landscapes of meadows, heaths and grasslands that characterized our cultural landscapes before the advent of modern agriculture.
But new research from Aarhus University suggests that this is not the case. Elena Pearce, postdoc at the Department of Biology at Aarhus University, and the lead author of the study explains.
""The idea that the landscape was covered by dense forest across most of the continent is simply not right. Our results show that we need to reassess our view of what European nature is,"" she says, and her colleague and co-author Professor Jens-Christian Svenning continues:
""Nature during the last interglacial period -- a period with a mild climate similar to today, but before modern humans arrived -- was full of variation. Importantly, the landscapes harboured large amounts of open and semi-open vegetation with shrubs, light-demanding trees and herbs alongside stands of tall-growing shade trees.""
Glacial and interglacial periods
Variations in the Earth's orbit around the sun and shifts in the tectonic plates mean that our planet is impacted by long periods with colder temperatures. We call these periods ice ages or glacial periods.

Researchers agree that there have been at least five major glacial periods during the Earth's four-billion-year history. The earliest glacial period was about 2 billion years ago and lasted for around 300 million years.
Although it may seem confusing, we are actually in such a major glacial period right now. Researchers also divide the glacial periods into cold and warm periods, namely the individual ice ages and intermittent warmer periods, the interglacials
The current glacial period has lasted for almost 2.6 million years, but we are currently in an interglacial period, now being exacerbated and likely prolonged by human greenhouse gas emissions. The study is about the previous interglacial period, which lasted from 129,000 years ago to around 115,000 years ago. In Europe, this interglacial period is called Eem.
Ancient pollen samples reveal what nature was like
Samples of ancient pollen helped the research team identify which plants grew more than 100,000 years ago in the last interglacial period.
The research group integrated data from pollen samples from large parts of Europe. The samples reveal that plants that do not thrive in dense forest often constituted large components of the vegetation.

""Tall-growing shade trees like spruce, linden, beech and hornbeam will be most prevalent in dense forests. However, the results show that hazel often covered large areas of the landscapes. Hazel is a bush that doesn't grow in large quantities in dense forest,"" says Jens-Christian Svenning.
In the world of plants, competition for sunlight is fierce. The trees that reach highest with their crowns can capture the most sunlight and win that competition. In beech forests, trees take almost all the sunlight. This means that other, smaller trees and shrubs, such as hazel, cannot grow in a beech forest.
""Hazel thrives in the open countryside and in open or disturbed forest, and tolerates disturbance from large animals. Whereas species like beech and spruce often are severely damaged or killed by cutting or browsing, hazel can manage without problems. Even if you cut down a hazel, it will still produce lots of new shoots,"" he says.
""For this reason, hazel was often very common in historical coppice woodlands.""
What pollen can reveal about the past
Almost all trees, flowers and shrubs give off pollen. Pollen is to plants what sperm cells are to animals. In order for a plant to seed, its egg cells must be pollinated.
Pollen is spread by the wind or by insects.
A lot of pollen lands on the ground, where it cannot pollinate other plants. Instead, it is eaten by insects or degraded by microorganisms. However, a small amount of pollen lands in lakes, bogs or streams, where it falls to the seabed.
Below the surface, there is often no oxygen and no life, and the pollen is preserved over hundreds of thousands of years in the soil layers.
By looking at the composition of different types of pollen in the soil layers of ancient, buried wetlands, researchers can deduce what the vegetation looked like more than 100,000 years ago.
Large animals kept the landscape open
So there are indications that Europe was not covered by dense forest before humans came into existence. But what did the landscape actually look like?
According to calculations from the new study, somewhere between 50 and 75 per cent of the landscape was covered by open or semi-open vegetation. And this is most likely due to the large mammals that lived at that time, explains Jens-Christian Svenning.
""We know that a lot of large animals lived in Europe at that time. Aurochs, horses, bison, elephants and rhinos. They must have consumed large amounts of plant biomass and thereby had the capacity to keep the tree-growth in check,"" he says and continues:
""Of course, it's also likely that other factors such as floods and forest fires also played a part. But there's no evidence to suggest that this caused enough disturbance. For example, forest fires encourage pine trees, but mostly we did not find pine as a dominant species.""
Although the research group cannot be 100 percent certain about the extent to which large animals were behind the open areas, there are strong indications that they were. Firstly, large animals such as bison have exactly that effect in areas where they are still found in European forests. Furthermore, beetle fossils from the last interglacial period also show that many large animals lived at that time.
""We have looked at a number of finds of beetle fossils from that time in the UK. Although there are beetle species that thrive in forests with frequent forest fires, we found none of them in the fossil data. Instead, we found large quantities dung beetles, and this shows that parts of the landscape have been densely populated by large herbivores,"" he says.
Merck's rhinoceros with pollen between its teeth
There are many indications that large animals kept the landscape varied before humans came, with large areas of open and semi-open vegetation.
A very special study from Poland further underlines this theory, says Jens-Christian Svenning.
""In Poland, researchers have taken a closer look at fossils from Merck's rhinoceros to see what this large animal lived on. They found remnants of pollen and twigs between its teeth, and when they analysed them, they could see that a large amount came from hazel,"" he says and continues:
""So the rhinoceros has trudged around eating branches and leaves from hazel bushes. This supports the theory that the large animals have affected the vegetation, perhaps just like historical coppice woodlands. At the same time, marks of its teeth suggest it had foraged a lot on grass and sedges through its life time.""
An argument for rewilding
Not only do we need to rewrite the biology books, but the new findings provide new data to support trophic rewilding, which is the restoration of biodiverse, self-regulated ecosystems via the re-establishment of food-web processes, notably as mediated by wild megafauna species.
The results in the study support that large animals have an essential role to play in restoration, as Elena Pearce explains.
""Now we know that there was a great deal of variation in the landscape. Everything suggests that this variation arose because of large animals affecting the vegetation structure. Many of the large animals from the interglacial period are now extinct, but we still have bison, horses and oxen,"" she says and concludes:
""Without large animals, natural areas become dominated by dense vegetation, in which many species of plants and butterflies, for example, cannot thrive. Therefore, it's important we restore large animals to the ecosystems if we are to encourage biodiversity.""

In particular, the temperate forest biome has traditionally been defined as dense, closed-canopy forest; however, some argue that large herbivores maintained greater openness or even wood-pasture conditions. Here, we address this question for the Last Interglacial period (129,000–116,000 years ago), before Homo sapiens –linked megafauna declines and anthropogenic landscape transformation. We applied the vegetation reconstruction method REVEALS to 96 Last Interglacial pollen records. We found that light woodland and open vegetation represented, on average, more than 50% cover during this period. The degree of openness was highly variable and only partially linked to climatic factors, indicating the importance of natural disturbance regimes. Our results show that the temperate forest biome was historically heterogeneous rather than uniformly dense, which is consistent with the dependency of much of contemporary European biodiversity on open vegetation and light woodland."

New research sheds light on the dining habits of ancient carnivorous dinosaurs from Jurassic rocks of the USA. A recent scientific study published in PeerJ Life & Environment by Roberto Lei (Università degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia) and colleagues explores the bite marks left on the ancient bones of the giant long-necked sauropod dinosaurs like Diplodocus and Brontosaurus by carnivorous theropod dinosaurs.

Tooth-marked bones provide invaluable insights into the feeding behaviors of long-extinct carnivorous creatures. While it is commonly thought that the giant tyrannosaurs were the primary culprits behind these tell-tale marks on dinosaur bones, the research conducted by Lei and colleagues takes a closer look at other large carnivores' contributions to this paleontological puzzle.
The study presents the results of an extensive survey of the literature and fossil collections, revealing a striking discovery: 68 sauropod bones from the Upper Jurassic (c. 150 million years old) Morrison Formation of the USA bear unmistakable bite traces attributed to theropods.
The team's findings suggest that while bite traces on large sauropods were less common than in tyrannosaur-dominated environments, they are nonetheless abundant in the Morrison Formation and more so than previously realised. A particularly intriguing aspect of their discovery is that none of the observed traces showed any evidence of healing, indicating that these bites occurred either in a single, lethal encounter or more likely were post-mortem feeding traces from scavenging.
The team also looked at the wear on the teeth of Morrison Formation theropods and foiund that they similarly show wear associated with biting bones more often than previous realised and are closer to the patterns seen in the large tyrannosaurs. However, attributing bite traces to specific theropod taxa remains a complex challenge due to the presence of multiple credible candidates and so it is very hard to attribute any single bite on the sauropod bones to the predators around like Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus.
Dr. David Hone of Queen Mary University of London, the corresponding author of the study, elaborates on the implications of their findings: ""This new work helps us understand the ecological relationships between dinosaurs in the Jurassic and reveals that the habits of the larger carnivores then were closer to that of the tyrannosaurs than previously thought. It's another important step in reconstructing the behaviour of these ancient animals.""
This research not only enhances our understanding of ancient ecosystems and the dynamics between predator and prey but also raises intriguing questions about the intricate web of life in the late Jurassic period. By focusing on bite and tooth marks, the authors have opened up a new window of investigation and knowledge, where these remarkable conclusions tell a story of predators and their interactions with some of the largest creatures to ever roam the Earth.

Here we report on an extensive survey of the literature and some fossil collections cataloging a large number of sauropod bones (68) from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the USA that bear bite traces that can be attributed to theropods. We find that such bites on large sauropods, although less common than in tyrannosaur-dominated faunas, are known in large numbers from the Morrison Formation, and that none of the observed traces showed evidence of healing. The presence of tooth wear in non-tyrannosaur theropods further shows that they were biting into bone, but it remains difficult to assign individual bite traces to theropod taxa in the presence of multiple credible candidate biters. The widespread occurrence of bite traces without evidence of perimortem bites or healed bite traces, and of theropod tooth wear in Morrison Formation taxa suggests preferential feeding by theropods on juvenile sauropods, and likely scavenging of large-sized sauropod carcasses."

In the 1800s, some of the strongest earthquakes in recorded U.S. history struck North America's continental interior. Almost two centuries later, the central and eastern United States may still be experiencing aftershocks from those events, a new study finds.

When an earthquake strikes, smaller quakes known as aftershocks can continue to shake the area for days to years after the original earthquake occurred. These smaller quakes decrease over time and are part of the fault's readjustment process following the original quake. While aftershocks are smaller in magnitude than the main shock, they can still damage infrastructure and impede recovery from the original earthquake.
""Some scientists suppose that contemporary seismicity in parts of stable North America are aftershocks, and other scientists think it's mostly background seismicity,"" said Yuxuan Chen, a geoscientist at Wuhan University and lead author of the study. ""We wanted to view this from another angle using a statistical method.""
The study was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, AGU's journal dedicated to research on the structure, evolution and deformation of the interior of our planet.
Regions near these historic earthquakes' epicenters are still seismically active today, so it's possible that some modern earthquakes could be long-lived aftershocks of past quakes. However, they could also be foreshocks that precede larger earthquakes or background seismicity, which is the normal amount of seismic activity for a given region.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), there's no way to distinguish foreshocks from background seismicity until a larger earthquake strikes, but scientists can still discern aftershocks. Thus, identifying the cause of modern earthquakes is important for understanding these regions' future disaster risk, even if current seismic activity is causing little to no damage.
The team focused on three historic earthquake events estimated to range from magnitude 6.5-8.0: an earthquake near southeastern Quebec, Canada, in 1663; a trio of quakes near the Missouri-Kentucky border from 1811 to 1812; and an earthquake from Charleston, South Carolina, in 1886. These three events are the largest earthquakes in stable North America's recent history -- and larger quakes trigger more aftershocks.

The stable continental interior of North America is located far from plate boundaries and has less tectonic activity than regions close to plate boundaries, such as North America's west coast. As a result, the three study areas don't encounter earthquakes often, raising even more questions about the origins of their modern seismicity.
To figure out if some of today's earthquakes are long-lived aftershocks, the team first needed to determine which modern quakes to focus their efforts on. Aftershocks cluster around the original earthquake's epicenter, so they included earthquakes within a 250-kilometer (155-mile) radius of the historic epicenters. They focused on earthquakes that were greater than or equal to a magnitude of 2.5 because anything smaller than that is difficult to reliably record.
The team applied a statistical approach called the nearest neighbor method to USGS earthquake data to determine whether recent earthquakes were likely to be aftershocks or unrelated background seismic activity. Aftershocks occur close to the original quake's epicenter and before the level of background seismicity has resumed, according to the USGS. Thus, scientists can use a region's background seismicity and an earthquake's location to link a quake back to a mainshock.
""You use the time, distance and the magnitude of event pairs, and try to find the link between two events -- that's the idea,"" Chen said. ""If the distance between a pair of earthquakes is closer than expected from background events, then one earthquake is likely the aftershock of the other.""
Susan Hough, a geophysicist with the USGS who was not involved in the study, mentions that the distance between epicenters is only one piece of the puzzle.
""In some respects, the earthquakes look like aftershocks if you look at the spatial distribution, but earthquakes could be tightly clustered for a couple of reasons,"" Hough said. ""One is that they're aftershocks, but also you could have a process of creep going on that's not part of an aftershock process. Exactly what their results mean is still open to question.""
Looking at the spatial distribution, the study found that the 1663 aftershock sequence near southeastern Quebec, Canada, has ended and modern seismicity in the area is unrelated to the old quake. However, the other two historic events may still be triggering aftershocks centuries later.

Near the Missouri-Kentucky border, the researchers found that around 30% of all earthquakes from 1980 to 2016 were likely aftershocks from the major earthquakes that struck the area between 1811 and 1812. And in Charleston, South Carolina, the team found around 16% of modern-day quakes were likely aftershocks from the earthquake of 1886. Thus, modern seismicity in these regions is likely attributable to both aftershocks and background seismicity.
""It's kind of a mixture,"" Chen said.
For assessing a region's modern seismic risk, scientists monitor creep and background seismicity in addition to any aftershocks. The study found background seismicity to be the dominant cause of earthquakes in all three of the study regions, which could be a sign of continued strain accrual. Aftershock sequences weaken over time, but strain accrual can lead to larger earthquakes in the future. However, some faults can creep along without building up strain.
""To come up with a hazard assessment for the future, we really need to understand what happened 150 or 200 years ago,"" Hough said. ""So bringing modern methods to bear on the problem is important.""

Some workers view present‐day earthquakes there as long‐lived aftershocks; others view them as background seismicity concentrated in lithospheric weak zones. Separating long‐lived aftershocks from background seismicity, however, is challenging. Here, we used the nearest‐neighbor (NN) method to identify long‐lived aftershocks. The NN method calculates the distances between pairs of earthquakes in a space‐time‐magnitude domain. If the distances are too close to be expected for independent background events that follow the Gutenberg‐Richter law and Poisson distribution, the pairs are taken as clustered events (i.e., the later one in a pair is an aftershock of the earlier one). Our results suggest that, depending on the size and location of the 1811–1812 New Madrid mainshocks, 10.7%–65.0% of the M ≥ 2.5 earthquakes in the New Marid region between 1980 and 2016 may be long‐lived aftershocks. Similarly, considerable present‐day earthquakes in South Carolina are long‐lived aftershocks of the 1886 Charleston earthquake, but the contemporary seismicity in Charlevoix, Québec is predominately background seismicity. These results suggest that present‐day seismicity in stable North America, and perhaps other stable continents, includes both background seismicity and long‐lived aftershocks. Distinguishing aftershocks from background seismicity can be important for hazard assessment."

A research team from the University of Cologne, in collaboration with colleagues from the Leibniz Institute for Food Systems Biology in Freising, has discovered a receptor for bitter taste in twelve different cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays). The receptor belongs to the so-called taste receptors type 2 (T2R), which also make humans perceive bitter and potentially toxic foods. Until now, it was assumed that such receptors only occur in bony vertebrates. The work was published under the title 'A singular shark bitter taste receptor provides insights into the evolution of bitter taste perception' in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

In the past, molecular research has had limited information on sharks, as their genomes are often relatively large. Therefore, sequencing is often more complex and takes longer than with many other animals. However, the techniques are more advanced nowadays, providing ever more information on the gene sequences of many cartilaginous fishes. This enabled the neurobiologists lecturer (Privatdozent) Dr Maik Behrens and Tatjana Lang from the Leibniz Institute for Food Systems Biology and Professor Dr Sigrun Korsching at the Institute of Genetics of the University of Cologne to specifically search for bitter taste receptors in cartilaginous fish.
Twelve out of seventeen cartilaginous fish genomes studied contained genes for the taste receptors type 2, with only one T2R gene present in each species. The researchers named this single gene T2R1. The fact that only a single T2R gene was found suggests that it is the original form of these bitter taste receptors, which was not altered by gene duplication and subsequent different specialization of the resulting receptors.
'These findings give us new insights into the evolution of these receptors: We can look back almost 500 million years on the molecular and functional origin of an entire family of bitter taste receptors. Because that is how old the last common ancestor of cartilage and bony fish is,' says Sigrun Korsching. The authors have also introduced the T2R1 gene of the bamboo shark (C. plagiosum) and the catshark (S. canicula) into immortalized cell lines. The results showed that both sharks can taste bitter substances also perceived by humans, such as colchicine or bile acid. A screening of ninety-four human bitter substances identified eleven substances that could also activate the sharks' receptors. Some of these eleven substances also activate the bitter taste receptors of the 'living fossil' coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae), an ancient species of bony fish, as the authors have shown in a previous study. Sigrun Korsching summarizes that 'the extent to which this function has been conserved is astonishing, i.e. through the entire evolution of vertebrates.'

Often, such compounds are recognized by taste 2 receptors that mediate bitter taste in humans. Until now, bitter taste receptors have only been found in bony vertebrates, where they occur as a large family already in coelacanth, a “living fossil” and the earliest-diverging extant lobe-finned fish. Here, we have revisited the evolutionary origin of taste 2 receptors (T2Rs) making use of a multitude of recently available cartilaginous fish genomes. We have identified a singular T2R in 12 cartilaginous fish species (9 sharks, 1 sawfish, and 2 skates), which represents a sister clade to all bony fish T2Rs. We have examined its ligands for two shark species, a catshark and a bamboo shark. The ligand repertoire of bamboo shark represents a subset of that of the catshark, with roughly similar thresholds. Amarogentin, one of the most bitter natural substances for humans, also elicited the highest signal amplitudes with both shark receptors. Other subsets of ligands are shared with basal bony fish T2Rs indicating an astonishing degree of functional conservation over nearly 500 mya of separate evolution. Both shark receptors respond to endogenous steroids as well as xenobiotic compounds, whereas separate receptors exist for xenobiotics both in early- and late-derived bony vertebrates (coelacanth, zebrafish, and human), consistent with the shark T2R reflecting the original ligand repertoire of the ancestral bitter taste receptor at the evolutionary origin of this family."

Our story begins at the end of the 1980s, with a sheet of paper. On this sheet, a scientist calculated that the conversion of the chemical compound phosphite to phosphate would release enough energy to produce the cell's energy carrier -- the ATP molecule. In this way, it should therefore be possible for a microorganism to supply itself with energy. Unlike most living organisms on our planet, this organism would not be dependent on energy supply from light or from the decomposition of organic matter.

The scientist actually succeeded in isolating such a microorganism from the environment. Its energy metabolism is based on the oxidation of phosphite to phosphate, just as predicted by the calculation. But how exactly does the biochemical mechanism work? Regrettably, the key enzyme needed to understand the biochemistry behind the process remained hidden -- and thus the mystery remained unsolved for many years. In the following three decades, the sheet stayed in the drawer, the research approach was put on the back burner. Yet the scientist couldn't get the thought out of his head.
The scientist is Bernhard Schink, professor at the Limnological Institute of the University of Konstanz. Three decades after he made the calculation on paper, an unexpected discovery set the ball rolling again ...
A sewage plant, an unexpected find and a new species
What had been in the back of his mind for many years was finally found: of all places, in a sewage plant in Konstanz, only a few kilometres from Bernhard Schink's laboratory. Zhuqing Mao, a biology doctoral researcher from Konstanz, examined a sewage sludge sample and discovered a second microorganism that also gets its energy from phosphite. The Konstanz biologists led by Bernhard Schink placed this bacterium in an environment in which it had only phosphite as a food source. And indeed: the bacterial population grew.
""This bacterium subsists on phosphite oxidation, and as far as we know, exclusively on this reaction. It covers its energy metabolism this way, and can build up its cell substance from CO2 at the same time,"" explains Schink. ""This bacterium is an autotrophic organism, like a plant. It does, however, not need light like a plant, as it draws its energy from phosphite oxidation."" Surprisingly, it turned out that the bacterium is not only a new species, but actually forms an entirely new genus of bacteria.
Tracking down the molecular mechanism
From that point on, things happened very quickly. A whole network of Konstanz researchers dedicated themselves to unravelling the mystery, including Bernhard Schink, Nicolai Müller, David Schleheck, Jennifer Fleming and Olga Mayans. They produced a pure culture of this new bacterial strain, in which they were finally able to identify the key enzyme that triggers the oxidation of phosphite to phosphate.

""The breakthrough came with Nicolai Müller and his enzyme experiments,"" says David Schleheck. Nicolai Müller succeeded in clearly demonstrating the enzyme's activity, thereby uncovering the biochemical mechanism behind the key enzyme. Olga Mayans and Jennifer Fleming created a three-dimensional model of its enzyme structure and active centre to understand the reaction pathway.
""What was very surprising was that during its oxidation, phosphite is apparently coupled directly to the energy-carrier precursor AMP, whereby the energy carrier ADP is created. In a subsequent reaction, two of the generated ADPs are converted to one ATP, on which the organism ultimately lives,"" Nicolai Müller outlines the reaction pathway.
Finally, everything came together: The original sheet became a whole pile of papers, resulting in a publication in the scientific journal PNAS.
A remnant from 2.5 billion years ago
The discovery of a new type of energy metabolism is in itself a great scientific success. However, the research team thinks that this type of metabolism is by no means new, but very old, even ancient: around 2.5 billion years old.
""It is assumed that in the early days of evolution, when the Earth was cooling down, phosphorus was still present to a large extent in a partially reduced form and was only later gradually oxidized. The metabolism we have now discovered fits very well into the early phase of the evolution of microorganisms,"" Bernhard Schink explains.
The biochemical mechanism that the bacterium uses for its metabolism is therefore not new, but has most probably been preserved from the primeval times of our planet: back when life on our planet began and the first microorganisms had to feed on inorganic compounds such as phosphite. Thus the new scientific findings provide clues to the early biochemical evolution on our planet. In addition, they provide the key to a biochemical mechanism that makes life possible in very hostile places, possibly even on alien planets.
Who would have thought at the end of the 1980s that a piece of paper would set all this in motion ...

To date, two pure cultures of strictly anaerobic bacteria have been isolated that run their energy metabolism on the basis of phosphite oxidation, the Gram-negativeDesulfotignum phosphitoxidans(DSM 13687) and the Gram-positivePhosphitispora fastidiosa(DSM 112739). Here, we describe the key enzyme for dissimilatory phosphite oxidation in these bacteria. The enzyme catalyzed phosphite oxidation in the presence of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to form adenosine diphosphate (ADP), with concomitant reduction of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The enzyme ofP. fastidiosawas heterologously expressed inEscherichia coli. It has a molecular mass of 35.2 kDa and a high affinity for phosphite and NAD+. Its activity was enhanced more than 100-fold by addition of ADP-consuming adenylate kinase (myokinase) to a maximal activity between 30 and 80 mU x mg protein−1. A similar NAD-dependent enzyme oxidizing phosphite to phosphate with concomitant phosphorylation of AMP to ADP is found inD. phosphitoxidans,but this enzyme could not be heterologously expressed. Based on sequence analysis, these phosphite-oxidizing enzymes are related to nucleotide-diphosphate-sugar epimerases and indeed represent AMP-dependent phosphite dehydrogenases (ApdA). A reaction mechanism is proposed for this unusual type of substrate-level phosphorylation reaction."

As conceived by Charles Darwin in the 1800s, evolution is a slow, gradual process during which species adaptations are inherited incrementally over generations. However, today biologists can see how evolutionary changes unfold on much more accelerated timescales.

Rather than the evocative plants and animals of the Galapagos Islands that Darwin studied in forming his theory of evolution, Postdoctoral Scholar Joshua Borin and Associate Professor Justin Meyer of UC San Diego's School of Biological Sciences are documenting rapid evolutionary processes in simple laboratory flasks.
Borin and Meyer set bacteria and viruses together in a closed laboratory flask -- just two teaspoons large -- to study coevolution in action. As viruses infect their bacterial neighbors, the bacteria evolve new defensive measures to repel the attacks. The viruses then counter these adaptations with their own evolutionary changes that work around the new defensive measures.
In only three weeks, this accelerated arms race between bacteria (Escherichia coli) and viruses (bacteriophage, or ""phage"") results in several generations of evolutionary adaptations. The new findings, published in the journal Science, reveal the emergence of distinct evolutionary patterns.
""In this study we show the power of evolution,"" said Meyer, an associate professor in the Department of Ecology, Behavior and Evolution. ""We see how coevolution between bacteria and phage drive the emergence of a highly complicated ecological network. Evolution doesn't have to be slow and gradual as Darwin thought.""
Meyer says the new study offers fresh perspectives on how intricate ecological networks develop across disparate ecosystems, whether they are food webs across the savanna, pollinator networks in the rainforest or microbes interacting in the ocean.
As bacteria and viruses adapted to each other's presence over time, two prominent repeating patterns emerged. These included nestedness, a development in which narrow interactions between bacteria and virus specialists are ""nested"" within a broader range of generalist interactions; and modularity, in which interactions between species form modules within specialized groups, but not between groups.

""We were amazed to discover that our evolution experiment in tiny flasks had recapitulated the complex patterns that had been previously observed between bacteria and viruses collected at regional and transoceanic scales,"" said Borin.
""When our research team first quantified this multiscale pattern in environmental bacteria and phage interaction data, we thought the emergence of such complexity required long periods of evolution,"" added study coauthor Professor Joshua Weitz from the Department of Biology at the University of Maryland.
Meyer says capturing these evolutionary developments ""in action"" reinforces the power of evolution, which is often underestimated. Rapid pathogenic evolution continues to shape our world in new ways. Through COVID-19 and new mutations of SARS-CoV-2, viruses have demonstrated the potent capability for evolutionary adaptations that result in new strains when they encounter antibodies, vaccines and other roadblocks that keep them from effectively infecting and spreading. Such new concepts in microbial evolution are reframing the way patients are treated.
""We show that evolution can produce complex ecological networks quickly from very little external help,"" said Meyer, who indicated that examples of such external evolutionary forces include isolation via geographical distance, environmental drivers and interactions with other species. ""So we can use phage and bacteria as a model system to understand general evolutionary principles and help show how life on Earth has evolved into such diverse and complex ecosystems from simple beginnings.""
In related work, Meyer and Weitz are using artificial intelligence to study how phage could be used in the growing antibiotic resistance crisis. The research includes analysis of evolutionary data to determine which mutations in phage and bacteria can lead to infection and resistance. The research also highlights a new effort supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to study how ""jumbo"" phages could be used as new therapeutic agents.

In just 21 days of laboratory coevolution, Escherichia coli and bacteriophage Φ21 coevolve and diversify to form elaborate cross-infection networks. By measuring ~10,000 phage-bacteria infections and testing the genetic basis of interactions, we identify the mechanisms that create each component of the multiscale pattern. Our results demonstrate how multiscale networks evolve in parasite-host systems, illustrating Darwin’s idea that simple adaptive processes can generate entangled banks of ecological interactions."

The cradle of palaeontology -- the study of fossil remains of animals and plants -- lies in the Maastricht limestones, where the first Mosasaurus was discovered in 1766. The Dutch-Belgian border area around the Limburg capital is one of the best-explored areas in the world where Cretaceous rocks are concerned, the era that came to an abrupt end 66 million years ago. New data can now be added to all previous knowledge: the Maastricht mosasaurs turned out to be quite picky in their choice of diet. This is the conclusion of researchers from Utrecht University and the Natural History Museum Maastricht. In collaboration with English colleagues from the University of Leicester, they were the first in the world to study the wear marks on mosasaur teeth.

""We were curious whether different species of mosasaurs around Maastricht were really getting in each other's way in their choice of food, or whether this was not so much of a problem,"" explains Dr Femke Holwerda, palaeontologist at the Utrecht University Faculty of Geosciences. In the absence of data on stomach contents of the Maastricht monitor lizards, the researchers therefore looked at minute scratches on the teeth of these animals from southern Limburg (the Netherlands) and in the vicinity of Eben-Emael (province of Liège, Belgium).
Seafood banquet
""It seems that the various species of mosasaur reveal differences in diet. We noted these differences mainly between the smaller species -- by mosasaur standards -- of about three to seven metres in overall size, and the larger ones, eight to fifteen metres in length."" But there were also some differences between the larger species. ""Prognathodon in particular, with its large cone-shaped teeth, appears to have had a surprising amount of shellfish in its diet, so it apparently loved its seafood buffet. Another species, Plioplatecarpus, with narrow pointed teeth, showed a striking number of signs of wear. Perhaps this species was also fond of fish with strongly scaled bodies.""
First
The researchers first made casts of the teeth in silicone rubber and put them in the 3D scanner. ""This technique had already been used in dinosaurs, but we were the first to look at the teeth of mosasaurs in the same way,"" explains fellow palaeontologist Anne Schulp, also affiliated with Utrecht University.
Diversity
With this research, some missing pieces of the puzzle from the long-gone latest Cretaceous world are found. ""We wish to understand diversity better,"" says Schulp. ""And that is made easier for us because the animals studied all come from the same rocks, and therefore the same period. So instead of describing just one species, we look at the ecosystem as a whole.""

Soft limestone
The limestone deposits around Maastricht are a goldmine for palaeontologists. Schulp: ""Nowhere else in the world is the habitat of mosasaurus as well preserved as here. You can find them in very soft limestone, so wear and tear of the teeth from other causes may be ruled out.""
Of course, such an abundance of potential finds also exerts a great attraction on amateur palaeontologists. ""There's nothing wrong with that,"" emphasises John Jagt, curator at the Natural History Museum Maastricht. ""Amateur literally means 'enthusiast' and thanks to 250 years of intensive research by these enthusiasts, we have learnt a lot about mosasaurs and other extinct life forms. A museum like ours benefits greatly from this. What also helps is that this kind of amateur science is stimulated in the Netherlands: it is simply allowed by law. That's not the case everywhere.""

The type-Maastrichtian strata (68–66 Ma) of the Netherlands and Belgium preserve remains of five species that seemed to have performed different ecological roles (carnivores, piscivores, durophages). However, many interpretations of mosasaur diet and niche partitioning are based on qualitative types of evidence that are difficult to test explicitly. Here, we apply three-dimensional dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) to provide quantitative dietary constraints for type-Maastrichtian mosasaurs, and to assess levels of niche partitioning between taxa. DMTA indicates that these mosasaurs did not exhibit neatly defined diets or strict dietary partitioning. Instead, we identify three broad groups: (i) mosasaurs Carinodens belgicus and Plioplatecarpus marshi plotting in the space of modern reptiles that are predominantly piscivorous and/or consume harder invertebrate prey, (ii) Prognathodon saturator and Prognathodon sectorius overlapping with extant reptiles that consume larger amounts of softer invertebrate prey items, and (iii) Mosasaurus hoffmanni spanning a larger plot area in terms of dietary constraints. The clear divide between the aforementioned first two groups in texture-dietary space indicates that, despite our small sample sizes, this method shows the potential of DMTA to test hypotheses and provide quantitative constraints on mosasaur diets and ecological roles."

A recent study by University of Helsinki researchers sheds new light on the ecological adaptability of early humans at the time when they first expanded their range outside Africa, 2-1 million years ago.

The origins of human genus have long been associated with savannah and grassland environments of Africa. Due to this association, it was thought that the first human dispersal into Eurasia followed grassy corridors leading from Africa to Asia and to Europe. This link between humans and savannah-grasslands has been considered so strong that it delayed the appearance of early humans in Europe compared to Asia, as open grassy environments appeared in Europe later than in Asia. According to this view, early humans were ecologically clearly less versatile than our own species, Homo sapiens, as we have colonized almost all terrestrial environments on the planet.
""But that's clearly not the whole story"" Says the lead author Tegan Foister, a doctoral researcher in the Hominin Ecology group at the University of Helsinki. ""Because we knew of some studies suggesting that early humans were living in environments other than savannah-grassland, we thought that it would be interesting to do a more systematic investigation on the environments humans are known to have occupied during this crucial time period.""
The research published in Evolutionary Anthropology is a systematic review of 121 previously published reconstructions of early human habitats and it revealed that humans, when dispersing out of Africa for the first time, started to occupy a diverse set of environments from grasslands to forests.
""We have long associated early humans with savannah-like environments outside of the African continent. However, when the research published over the past two decades is considered together, it shows humans inhabiting diverse environments early in the evolution of the genus Homo. Already one million years ago humans in Europe were occupying fully forested environments."" Foister continues.
Although the analysis shows that grasslands and savannahs were important components of early human habitats, it places humans into a wide spectrum of environments, and in many cases environments with varied vegetation composition. This suggests that commonly held believes about early humans are not entirely correct: Humans did not have that strict requirements for their habitats and they seem to have been ecologically more versatile than previously assumed.
The study also indicated regional differences in human habitat characteristics. The grasslands and savannahs show the highest prevalence among African habitats, whereas forested habitats were more prominent in Eurasia making the range of different habitats wider in Eurasia. This suggests a possibility that the first human range expansion into Eurasia was accompanied and potentially even enabled by the expansion of human ecological niche.
The research is part of University of Helsinki and Kone Foundation funded project that investigates the evolution of the human niche over the past 2 million years. Although the present study focuses on the early humans, its findings are important also to the understanding of the origins of uniquely wide niche of our own species Homo sapiens. Co-author Miikka Tallavaara, leader of the project and the Hominin Ecology group, says: ""The ability of Homo sapiens to occupy most of the terrestrial ecosystems has enabled our ecological dominance and triggered the current biodiversity crisis. Our finding that human species in the Early Pleistocene were also able to thrive in multiple environment types provides an exciting target for future research into the evolutionary origins of the human plasticity and ecological success.""

We examined 121 published environmental reconstructions from 74 early Pleistocene sites or site phases to assess the balance of arguments in the research community. We found that, while grasslands and savannahs were prominent features of Homo habitats in the early Pleistocene, current research does not place early Pleistocene Homo, in any single environmental type, but in a wide variety of environments, ranging from open grasslands to forests.

A new analysis of lice genetic diversity suggests that lice came to the Americas twice -- once during the first wave of human migration across the Bering Strait, and again during European colonization. Marina Ascunce, currently at the USDA-ARS, and colleagues, report these findings in a new study published November 8 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE.

The human louse is a wingless, blood-sucking parasite that lives its entire life on its host. It is one of the oldest known parasites to live on humans, and the two species have coevolved for millennia. Due to this intimate relationship, studying lice can offer clues to how humans evolved as well. In the new study, researchers analyzed the genetic variation in 274 human lice from 25 geographic sites around the world.
A genetic analysis based on louse DNA revealed the existence of two distinct clusters of lice that rarely interbred. Cluster I had a worldwide distribution, while cluster II was found in Europe and the Americas. The only lice with ancestry from both clusters are found in the Americas. This distinct group appears to be the result of a mixture between lice descended from populations that arrived with the First People and those descended from European lice, which were brought over during the colonization of the Americas.
The researchers also identified a genetic relationship between lice in Asia and Central America. This supports the idea that people from East Asia migrated to North America and became the first Native Americans. These people then spread south into Central America, where modern louse populations today still retain a genetic signature from their distant Asian ancestors.
The patterns observed in the new study support existing ideas about human migration and provide additional knowledge about how lice have evolved. The researchers point out that they selected genetic markers that evolve quickly and are best suited to recent events. Thus, future studies that use markers that have changed more slowly could shed light on more ancient events. Additionally, the methods developed for this work could guide the development of new analyses to study other host-parasite systems.
The authors add: ""Human lice are more than annoying human parasites, they are 'satellites' of our evolution. Because human lice feed on human blood, they need us to survive, and over millions of years this resulted in a long co-evolutionary history together.""

In this study, we analyzed the genetic variation in 274 human lice from 25 geographic sites around the world by using nuclear microsatellite loci and female-inherited mitochondrial DNA sequences. Nuclear genetic diversity analysis revealed the presence of two distinct genetic clusters I and II, which are subdivided into subclusters: Ia-Ib and IIa-IIb, respectively. Among these samples, we observed the presence of the two most common louse mitochondrial haplogroups: A and B that were found in both nuclear Clusters I and II. Evidence of nuclear admixture was uncommon (12%) and was predominate in the New World potentially mirroring the history of colonization in the Americas. These findings were supported by novel DIYABC simulations that were built using both host and parasite data to define parameters and models suggesting that admixture between cI and cII was very recent. This pattern could also be the result of a reproductive barrier between these two nuclear genetic clusters. In addition to providing new evolutionary knowledge about this human parasite, our study could guide the development of new analyses in other host-parasite systems."

Some unexpected shark strandings and subsequent surprises following autopsies have, ironically, taken marine biologists millions of years back in time as they look to the future with concern. Adding chapters to an evolutionary tale involving the infamous megalodon shark (the ""Meg""), they think their work suggests there are more warm-blooded sharks out there than previously believed, and -- based on the Meg's demise -- these species may be at great risk from warming seas.

Some of the most famous sharks, like the white shark or the extinct megalodon, are unusual in being among the mere ~1% of shark species to be considered warm-blooded or ""regional endotherms.""
It had always been thought warmer muscles help fish be powerful and athletic, with regional endothermy only seen in apex predators like the great white or giant tuna. But there has also been some debate about when regional endothermy evolved, and whether extinct species like the megalodon was warm bodied.
In a new study led by Trinity College Dublin, researchers have found that a relatively ancient (but still-living) shark species -- the smalltooth sand tiger, thought to have diverged from the Meg at least 20 million years ago -- has anatomic features suggesting it is a regional endotherm. Coming hot on the fins of a similar shock that slow-moving, filter-feeding basking sharks are also regional endotherms, the researchers now believe there are more warm-blooded sharks than science thought, and that warm bloodedness evolved quite a long time ago.
Dr Nicholas Payne from Trinity's School of Natural Sciences was senior author of the study, published this week in Biology Letters. He said:
""We think this is an important finding, because if sand tiger sharks have regional endothermy then it's likely there are several other sharks out there that are also warm-bodied.
""We used to think regional endothermy was confined to apex predators like the great white and extinct megalodon, but now we have evidence that deep water 'bottom dwelling' sand tigers, and plankton-eating basking sharks also are warm bodied. This raises plenty of new questions as to why regional endothermy evolved, but it might also have important conservation implications.""
The research team (including scientists from University of Pretoria, ZSL, University of Zurich, Swansea University, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and University College Dublin College of Agriculture Food Science and Veterinary Medicine) undertook dissections of dead smalltooth sand tiger sharks that washed up in Ireland and the UK in making their discoveries.

Dr Haley Dolton, also from Trinity, was lead author of the study. She said:
""Our understanding of science continually grows and it's becoming clear that whenever regional endothermy evolved in the past it has been retained in a growing number of shark species with very different life styles. When we first realised that the smalltooth tigers have traits associated with regional endotherms I thought 'here we go again!', but the next time we see it in another species I might be a little less shocked.
""The discovery itself is very interesting for a marine biologist, but it also has major implications from a conservation perspective for regional endotherms. We believe changing environments in the deep past was a major contributor to the megalodon's extinction, as we think it could no longer meet the energetic demands of being a large regional endotherm. We know the seas are warming at alarming rates again now and the smalltooth tiger that washed up in Ireland was the first one seen in these waters. That implies its range has shifted, potentially due to warming waters, so a few alarm bells are ringing.""

Here we show a basal lamniform shark, the smalltooth sand tiger shark Odontaspis ferox , has centralized skeletal red muscle and a thick compact-walled ventricle; anatomical features generally consistent with regionally endothermy. This result, together with the recent discovery of probable red muscle endothermy in filter feeding basking sharks Cetorhinus maximus , suggests that this thermophysiology is more prevalent in the Lamniformes than previously thought, which in turn has implications for understanding the evolution of regional endothermy, gigantism, and extinction risk of warm-bodied shark species both past and present."

New maps of more than 1,000 deep-seated landslides in the Puget Lowlands of Washington State provide evidence of the last major earthquake along the Seattle Fault about 1,100 years ago -- and may also hold traces of older earthquakes along the fault.

Clusters of landslides offer a potential record of earthquakes, if researchers can determine when the landslides occurred. The new study published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America combines information about the location of these Puget Lowlands landslides along with new dates obtained from measuring the surface roughness of the landslides.
The combination of data helped Erich Herzig of the University of Washington and colleagues uncover strong evidence of the last known major Seattle Fault earthquake, thought to be a magnitude 7 to 7.5 event. (A recent study suggested that there may have even been a double earthquake at the time in the region.)
The researchers compared their new landslide map to ground motions generated by different Seattle Fault earthquake scenarios. The scenario that best matches the landslide clusters, they found, is one that produces the strongest shaking in a west to east band from west Seattle to Mercer Island and the bluffs bordering Puget Sound.
""While other studies have refined our understanding of the overall strength or timing of the 1,100-year-old Seattle Fault earthquake, to our knowledge, this is the first study that has attempted to characterize the locations of strong shaking,"" Herzig said.
Herzig and colleagues also uncovered other landslide clusters at 4600-4200 years ago, 4000-3800 years ago, 2800 to 2600 years ago, and 2200 to 2000 years ago that could be signs of older Seattle Fault earthquakes.
They began by mapping more than 1,000 deep-seated landslides across the Puget Lowlands -- deep-seated refers to landslides where the slide plane lays below the roots of the trees -- using a technique called airborne lidar.

""Airborne lidar is a technology where a plane mounted with lasers is used to measure the shape of the land surface in detail, even through vegetation,"" Herzig explained. ""In the past few years this technology has been able to produce maps at one meter resolution or better, which is essential for measuring roughness as we do in the paper.""
Measuring the roughness of a landslide surface is a relatively new technique used by scientists to estimate the age of a landslide, he noted. The general idea is that ground surfaces roughen after the mass movement of rocks and soil, so that landslide deposits are the roughest right after the landslide occurs and become smoother over time. By modeling this age-roughness relationship, with information from landslides dated by other means such as carbon dating, researchers can estimate when a particular landslide took place.
For the landslides in the BSSA study, Herzig and colleagues calculated roughness by measuring variations in the land surface in a 15-meter-wide circle. Carbon dating of wood at some landslides provided data for calibrating the landslide ages.
The researchers uncovered spatial patterns in the landslides that correlate with the ground motions predicted by models of Seattle Fault earthquakes. They also noted that the timing of landslides in the Puget Lowland fits better with a model of a pulse of landslides at the time of the last major Seattle Fault earthquake, rather than a model of landslides happening steadily through time.
The researchers said their method offers a powerful new way of extracting information about past earthquakes from landslide data.
""This method is best suited to understanding landscapes that have hills that are steep enough to have landslides, and that have infrequent but powerful earthquakes,"" Herzig said. ""In the U.S., that could mean other locations in the Puget Lowlands area, or places in the New Madrid seismic zone. Other locations around the world could also be interesting to study, such as the Hinagu Fault zone in Japan, or the Hellenic arc in Greece.""

In this study, we present new mapping, Light Detection and Ranging-derived roughness dating, and analysis of over 1000 deep-seated landslides from the Puget Lowlands of Washington, U.S.A., to probe the landscape for past Seattle fault earthquake information. With this new landslide inventory, we observe spatial and temporal evidence of landsliding related to the last major earthquake on the Seattle fault ∼1100 yr before present. We find spatial clusters of landslides that correlate with ground motions from recent 3D kinematic models of Seattle fault earthquakes. We also find temporal patterns in the landslide inventory that suggest earthquake-driven increases in landsliding. We compare the spatial and temporal landslide data with scenario-based ground motion models and find stronger evidence of the last major Seattle fault earthquake from this combined analysis than from spatial or temporal patterns alone. We also compare the landslide inventory with ground motions from different Seattle fault earthquake scenarios to determine the ground motion distributions that are most consistent with the landslide record. We find that earthquake scenarios that best match the clustering of ∼1100-year-old landslides produce the strongest shaking within a band that stretches from west to east across central Seattle as well as along the bluffs bordering the broader Puget Sound. Finally, we identify other landslide clusters (at 4.6–4.2 ka, 4.0–3.8 ka, 2.8–2.6 ka, and 2.2–2.0 ka) in the inventory which let us infer potential ground motions that may correspond to older Seattle fault earthquakes. Our method, which combines hindcasting of the surface response to the last major Seattle fault earthquake, using a roughness-aged landslide inventory with forecasts of modeled ground shaking from 3D seismic scenarios, showcases a powerful new approach to gleaning paleoseismic information from landscapes."

Microfossils from Western Australia may capture a jump in the complexity of life that coincided with the rise of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere and oceans, according to an international team of scientists.

The findings, published in the journal Geobiology, provide a rare window into the Great Oxidation Event, a time roughly 2.4 billion years ago when the oxygen concentration increased on Earth, fundamentally changing the planet's surface. The event is thought to have triggered a mass extinction and opened the door for the development of more complex life, but little direct evidence had existed in the fossil record before the discovery of the new microfossils, the scientists said.
""What we show is the first direct evidence linking the changing environment during the Great Oxidation Event with an increase in the complexity of life,"" said corresponding author Erica Barlow, an affiliate research professor in the Department of Geosciences at Penn State. ""This is something that's been hypothesized, but there's just such little fossil record that we haven't been able to test it.""
When compared to modern organisms, the microfossils more closely resembled a type of algae than simpler prokaryotic life -- organisms like bacteria, for example -- that existed prior to the Great Oxidation Event, the scientists said. Algae, along with all other plants and animals, are eukaryotes, more complex life whose cells have a membrane-bound nucleus.
More work is required to determine if the microfossils were left behind by eukaryotic organisms, but the possibility would have significant implications, the scientists said. It would push back the known eukaryotic microfossil record by 750 million years.
""The microfossils have a remarkable similarity to a modern family called Volvocaceae,"" Barlow said. ""This hints at the fossil being possibly an early eukaryotic fossil. That's a big claim, and something that needs more work, but it raises an exciting question that the community can build on and test.""
Barlow discovered the rock containing the fossils while conducting her undergraduate research at the University of New South Wales (USNW) in Australia, and she conducted the current work as part of her doctoral work at UNSW and then while a postdoctoral researcher at Penn State.

""These specific fossils are remarkably well preserved, which allowed for the combined study of their morphology, composition, and complexity,"" said Christopher House, professor of geosciences at Penn State and a co-author of the study. ""The results provide a great window into a changing biosphere billions of years ago.""
The scientists analyzed the chemical makeup and carbon isotopic composition of the microfossils and determined the carbon was created by living organisms, confirming that the structures were indeed biologic fossils. They also uncovered insights into the habitat, reproduction and metabolism of the microorganisms.
Barlow compared the samples to microfossils from before the Great Oxidation Event and could not find comparable organisms. The microfossils she found were larger and featured more complex cellular arrangements, she said.
""The record seems to reveal a burst of life -- there's an increase in diversity and complexity of this fossilized life that we are finding,"" Barlow said.
Compared to modern organisms, Barlow said, the microfossils have explicit similarities with algal colonies, including in the shape, size and distribution of both the colony and individual cells and membranes around both cell and colony.
""They have a remarkable similarity and so, by that way of comparison, we could say these fossils were relatively complex,"" Barlow said. ""There is nothing like them in the fossil record, and yet, they have quite striking similarities to modern algae.""
The findings have implications for both how long it took complex life to form on early Earth -- the earliest, uncontroversial evidence of life is 3.5 billion years old -- and what the search for life elsewhere in the solar system may reveal, the scientists said.

""I think finding a fossil that is this relatively large and complex, relatively early on in the history of life on Earth, kind of makes you question -- if we do find life elsewhere, it might not just be bacterial prokaryotic life,"" Barlow said. ""Maybe there's a chance there could be something more complex preserved -- even if it's still microscopic, it could be something of a slightly higher order.""

Over 100 letters sent to French sailors by their fiancées, wives, parents and siblings -- but never delivered -- have been opened and studied for the first time since they were written in 1757-8.
 The messages offer extremely rare and moving insights into the loves, lives and family quarrels of everyone from elderly peasants to wealthy officer's wives. The messages were seized by Britain's Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, taken to the Admiralty in London and never opened. The collection is now held at the National Archives in Kew. The letters provide precious new evidence about French women and labourers, as well as different forms of literacy.""I could spend the night writing to you … I am your forever faithful wife. Good night, my dear friend. It is midnight. I think it is time for me to rest.""
So wrote Marie Dubosc to her husband, the first Lieutenant of theGalatée, a French warship, in 1758. She didn't know where Louis Chambrelan was, or that his ship had been captured by the British. He would never receive her letter and they would never meet again. Marie died the following year in Le Havre, almost certainly before Louis was released. In 1761, he remarried, safely back in France.
""I cannot wait to possess you"" wrote Anne Le Cerf to her husband, a non-commissioned officer on the Galatée.She perhaps meant ""embrace"" but also ""to make love to you."" She signed ""Your obedient wife Nanette,"" an affectionate nickname. Imprisoned somewhere in England, Jean Topsent would never receive Nanette's love letter.
Professor Renaud Morieux, from Cambridge University's History Faculty and Pembroke College, spent months decoding these and 102 other letters written with wild spelling, no punctuation or capitalization and filling every inch of the expensive paper they appear on. He published his findings today in the journal Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales.
""I only ordered the box out of curiosity,"" Morieux said. ""There were three piles of letters held together by ribbon. The letters were very small and were sealed so I asked the archivist if they could be opened and he did. I realized I was the first person to read these very personal messages since they were written. Their intended recipients didn't get that chance. It was very emotional.""
""These letters are about universal human experiences, they're not unique to France or the 18th century. They reveal how we all cope with major life challenges. When we are separated from loved-ones by events beyond our control like the pandemic or wars, we have to work out how to stay in touch, how to reassure, care for people and keep the passion alive. Today we have Zoom and WhatsApp. In the 18th century, people only had letters but what they wrote about feels very familiar.""
Captured and out of luck

During the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), France commanded some of the world's finest ships but lacked experienced sailors. Britain exploited this by imprisoning as many French sailors as it could for the duration of the war. In 1758, out of 60,137 French sailors, a third (19,632) were detained in Britain. Across the period of the Seven Years' War as a whole, there were 64,373 French sailors imprisoned in Britain.
Some of these men died from disease and malnutrition, but many others were released. In the meantime, their families waited and repeatedly tried to contact them and exchange news.
Morieux said: ""These letters show people dealing with challenges collectively. Today we would find it very uncomfortable to write a letter to a fiancée knowing that mothers, sisters, uncles, neighbours would read it before it was sent, and many others would read it upon receipt. It's hard to tell someone what you really think about them with people peering over your shoulder. There was far less of a divide between intimate and collective.""
In the 18th century, sending letters from France to a ship, a constantly moving target, was incredibly difficult and unreliable. Sometimes people sent multiple copies of letters to different ports hoping to reach a sailor. Relatives also asked the families of crewmates to insert messages to their loved-one in their letters. Morieux found extensive evidence of these strategies in the Galatée letters which like so many others, never reached their intended recipients.
The Galatée was sailing from Bordeaux to Quebec when, in 1758, it was captured by the British ship, the Essex, and sent to Portsmouth. The crew was imprisoned and the ship sold.
The French postal administration had tried to deliver the letters to the ship, sending them to multiple ports in France but always arrived just too late. When they had heard that the ship had been captured, they forwarded the letters to England, where they were handed to the Admiralty in London.

""It's agonising how close they got,"" Morieux said. Morieux believes that officials opened and read two letters to see if they had any military value but deciding they only contained ""family stuff,"" gave up and put them into storage.
Morieux identified every member of the Galatée's 181-strong crew from simple sailors to carpenters to superior officers. The letters were addressed to a quarter of them. Morieux carried out genealogical research into these men and their correspondents to learn more about their lives than the letters alone revealed.
Quarrels and tensions
The letters convey both romantic love and more often family love, but also offer rare insights into family tensions and quarrels at a time of war and prolonged absence. Some of the most remarkable letters were sent to the young sailor, Nicolas Quesnel, from Normandy. On 27 January 1758, his 61-year-old mother, Marguerite -- who was almost certainly illiterate -- sent a message written by an unknown scribe to complain:
""On the first day of the year [i.e. January 1st] you have written to your fiancée […]. I think more about you than you about me. […] In any case I wish you a happy new year filled with blessings of the Lord. I think I am for the tomb, I have been ill for three weeks. Give my compliments to Varin [a shipmate], it is only his wife who gives me your news.""
A few weeks later, Nicolas' fiancée, Marianne, wrote to instruct him to write to his mother to be a good son and stop putting her in an awkward situation. It seems that Marguerite had blamed Marianne for Nicolas' silence. Marianne wrote: ""the black cloud has gone, a letter that your mother has received from you, lightens the atmosphere.""
But on 7th March 1758, Marguerite wrote to Nicolas again to complain: ""In your letters you never mention your father. This hurts me greatly. Next time you write to me, please do not forget your father.""
Morieux discovered that, in fact, this man was Nicolas' step-father. His biological father had died and his mother remarried.
""Here is a son who clearly doesn't like or acknowledge this man as his father,"" Morieux said. ""But at this time, if your mother remarried, her new husband automatically became your father. Without explicitly saying it, Marguerite is reminding her son to respect this by sharing news about ""your father."" These are complex but very familiar family tensions.""
Nicolas Quesnel survived his imprisonment in England and, Morieux found, joined the crew of a transatlantic slave trade ship in the 1760s.
Women in wartime
Over half (59%) of the letters were signed by women and provide precious insights into female literacy, social networks, and experiences in wartime.
""These letters shatter the old-fashioned notion that war is all about men,"" Morieux said. ""While their men were gone, women ran the household economy and took crucial economic and political decisions.""
In this period, the French navy manned its warships by forcing most men living near the coast to serve for 1 year, every 3 or 4 years. This system was as unpopular as press-ganging in Britain and many French sailors ran away once in port or applied to be released on the basis of injury.
The sister of Nicolas Godefroy, a trainee pilot, wrote: ""What would bring me more pain is if you leave for the islands."" She meant the Caribbean where thousands of European sailors died from disease in this period. Nevertheless, Godefroy's sister and mother both refused to apply for his release from the navy. They feared that his proposed strategy could backfire and force him to stay at sea ""even longer.""
Who are you calling illiterate?
Morieux's study calls for a more inclusive definition of literacy.
""You can take part in a writing culture without knowing how to write nor read,"" he said. ""Most of the people sending these letters were telling a scribe what they wanted to say, and relied on others to read their letters aloud. This was someone they knew who could write, not a professional. Staying in touch was a community effort.""

Researchers in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, in collaboration with paleontologists from Spain and Poland, used fossil evidence to engineer a soft robotic replica of pleurocystitid, a marine organism that existed nearly 450 million years ago and is believed to be one of the first echinoderms capable of movement using a muscular stem.

Published today in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), the research seeks to broaden modern perspective of animal design and movement by introducing a new a field of study -- Paleobionics -- aimed at using Softbotics, robotics with flexible electronics and soft materials, to understand the biomechanical factors that drove evolution using extinct organisms.
""Softbotics is another approach to inform science using soft materials to construct flexible robot limbs and appendages. Many fundamental principles of biology and nature can only fully be explained if we look back at the evolutionary timeline of how animals evolved. We are building robot analogues to study how locomotion has changed,"" said Carmel Majidi, lead author and Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
With humans' time on earth representing only 0.007% of the planet's history, the modern-day animal kingdom that influences understanding of evolution and inspires today's mechanical systems is only a fraction of all creatures that have existed through history.
Using fossil evidence to guide their design and a combination of 3D printed elements and polymers to mimic the flexible columnar structure of the moving appendage, the team demonstrated that pleurocystitids were likely able to move over the sea bottom by means of a muscular stem that pushed the animal forward. Despite the absence of a current day analogue (echinoderms have since evolved to include modern day starfish and sea urchins), pleurocystitids have been of interest to paleontologists due to their pivotal role in echinoderm evolution.
The team determined that wide sweeping movements were likely the most effective motion and that increasing the length of the stem significantly increased the animals' speed without forcing it to exert more energy.
""Researchers in the bio-inspired robotics community need to pick and choose important features worth adopting from organisms,"" explained Richard Desatnik, PhD candidate and co-first author.

""Essentially, we have to decide on good locomotion strategies to get our robots moving. For example, would a starfish robot really need to use 5 limbs for locomotion or can we find a better strategy?"" added Zach Patterson, CMU alumnus and co-first author.
Now that the team has demonstrated that they can use Softbotics to engineer extinct organisms, they hope to explore other animals, like the first organism that could travel from sea to land -- something that can't be studied in the same way using conventional robot hardware.
""Bringing a new life to something that existed nearly 500 million years ago is exciting in and of itself, but what really excites us about this breakthrough is how much we will be able to learn from it,"" said Phil LeDuc, co-author, and Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. ""We aren't just looking at fossils in the ground, we are trying to better understand life through working with amazing paleontologists.""

The hunter-gatherers who settled on the banks of the Haine, a river in southern Belgium, 31,000 years ago were already using spearthrowers to hunt their game. This is the finding of a new study conducted at TraceoLab at the University of Liège. The material found at the archaeological site of Maisières-Canal permits establishing the use of this hunting technique 10,000 years earlier than the oldest currently known preserved spearthrowers. This discovery, published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports, is prompting archaeologists to reconsider the age of this important technological innovation.

The spearthrower is a weapon designed for throwing darts, which are large projectiles resembling arrows that generally measure over two metres long. Spearthrowers can propel darts over a distance of up to eighty metres. The invention of long-range hunting weapons has had significant consequences for human evolution, as it changed hunting practices and the dynamics between humans and their prey, as well as the diet and social organisation of prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups. The date of invention and spread of these weapons has therefore long been the subject of lively debate within the scientific community.
""Until now, the early weapons have been infamously hard to detect at archaeological sites because they were made of organic components that preserve rarely, explains Justin Coppe, researcher at TraceoLab. Stone points that armed ancient projectiles and that are much more frequently encountered at archaeological excavations have been difficult to connect to particular weapons reliably."" Most recently published claims for early use of spearthrowers and bows in Europe and Africa have relied exclusively on projectile point size to link them to these weapon systems. However, ethnographic reviews and experimental testing have cast serious doubt on this line of reasoning by showing that arrow, dart, and spear tips can be highly variable in size, with overlapping ranges.
The innovative approach developed by the archaeologists at TraceoLab combines ballistic analysis and fracture mechanics to gain a better understanding of the traces preserved on the flint points. ""We carried out a large-scale experiment in which we fired replicas of Palaeolithic projectiles using different weapons such as spears, bows and spearthrowers,"" explains Noora Taipale, FNRS research fellow at TraceoLab. By carefully examining the fractures on these stone points, we were able to understand how each weapon affected the fracturing of the points when they impacted the target.""  Each weapon left distinct marks on the stone points, enabling archaeologists to match these marks to archaeological finds. In a way, it's like identifying a gun from the marks the barrel leaves on a bullet, a practice known from forensic science.
The excellent match between the experimental spearthrower sample and the Maisières-Canal projectiles confirmed that the hunters occupying the site used these weapons. This finding encourages archaeologists to apply the method further to find out how ancient long-range weaponry really is. Future work at TraceoLab will focus on adjusting the analytical approach to other archaeological contexts to help reach this goal.

Hence knowing when different weapons were first introduced is important for understanding our evolutionary trajectory. The timing of the adoption of long-range weaponry remains heavily debated because preserved organic weapon components are extremely rare in the Paleolithic record and stone points are difficult to attribute reliably to weapon delivery methods without supporting organic evidence. Here, we use a refined use-wear approach to demonstrate that spearthrower was used for launching projectiles armed with tanged flint points at Maisières-Canal (Belgium) 31,000 years ago. The novelty of our approach lies in the combination of impact fracture data with terminal ballistic analysis of the mechanical stress suffered by a stone armature on impact. This stress is distinct for each weapon and visible archaeologically as fracture proportions on assemblage scale. Our reference dataset derives from a sequential experimental program that addressed individually each key parameter affecting fracture formation and successfully reproduced the archaeological fracture signal. The close match between the archaeological sample and the experimental spearthrower set extends the timeline of spearthrower use by over 10,000 years and represents the earliest reliable trace-based evidence for the utilization of long-distance weaponry in prehistoric hunting."

Deep in the forests of Haiti lives the blue-eyed La Hotte glanded frog (Eleutherodactylus glandulifer), which once went 20 years without being observed by scientists. It belongs to a diverse genus from the Caribbean that also includes the much more common coquí frog (Eleutherodactylus coquí), a cultural icon in Puerto Rico. Now, a new fossil study shows that frogs from the genus Eleutherodactylus are geologically the oldest Caribbean vertebrates to be found in Florida. They also arrived in North America much earlier than previously thought.

Although scientists knew some North American frogs had origins in the Caribbean, they lacked fossil evidence showing when and how this movement had occurred. But María Vallejo-Pareja, a graduate student at the University of Florida, used understudied fossil collections to connect the dots.
""There was a gap in knowledge, but the answer was under our noses the whole time,"" said Vallejo-Pareja, first author of the paper. ""We already had the fossils, which were collected from the 1970s through the 1990s. We just hadn't worked on them.""
Scientists have an incomplete record of the evolutionary history of frogs. Data analyses show that frog families underwent rapid diversification after the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction that famously killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Frogs continued to diversify for the next several million years. They first show up in Florida's fossil record during the Oligocene Epoch, which lasted from around 34 to 23 million years ago. However, records from these eras are patchy.
This is because frogs are understudied in comparison with other vertebrate groups, with frog paleontology being an especially small field.
This posed a challenge when researchers at the Florida Museum uncovered an abundance of frog fossils at paleontological sites in Florida dating back to the Oligocene, including the Brooksville 2 and Live Oak SB-1A locations. Since frogs weren't a research priority when many of the fossils were collected from the 1970s through the 1990s, they were put in storage, where they sat, unstudied, until Vallejo-Pareja's project.
Vallejo-Pareja compared fossils found at the sites in Florida with existing collections containing specimens from both extinct and living frogs, including the Florida Museum's samples of the La Hotte glanded frog. She found that most of the collected fossils belong to the genus Eleutherodactylus, commonly referred to as rain frogs or robber frogs.

Rain frogs have a history of moving around. They originated in the Caribbean from an ancestor that dispersed from South America as early as 47 million years ago during the Eocene Epoch. Once on the islands, the ancestral population rapidly diversified into several species through a process called adaptive radiation. The finches that Charles Darwin documented in the Galapagos Islands, where one migrant species quickly evolved into at least 13 different species as it filled new feeding niches, are a classic example of this.
Today, rain frogs are found in the Caribbean and parts of Central and North America. The oldest known fossil from the genus belongs to the coquí frog, which has been in Caribbean forests for at least 29 million years. In the 1970s and '80s, it was unintentionally imported to Florida and Hawaii on nursery plants and is now considered an invasive species in both states.
DNA analysis led scientists to believe that Caribbean frogs in the genus Eleutherodactylus first arrived in Central America during the middle Miocene Epoch, 16 to 11 million years ago, before dispersing to North America. The fossils from this study, however, show rain frogs were in Florida during the late Oligocene, several million years before their recorded dispersal into Central America.
Rain frogs are evidently good at getting around, but it's not clear how they made it to Florida. Overwater dispersal on flotsam or other buoyant debris seems the likeliest scenario, but most of the Florida peninsula was still underwater when the frogs are estimated to have arrived. The increased distance between land would have made their journey even longer and more perilous than it would be today.
It is possible there were different dispersal events, but Vallejo-Pareja says that hypothesis would need to be tested by finding more fossils in Central America. Because frogs are small and highly mobile, however, it is easy to underestimate the presence of frogs in an area and hard to track their dispersal.
""These fossils are millimeters big,"" Vallejo-Pareja said. The smallest fossil frog was estimated to measure only 16 millimeters from snout to rear end, smaller than a U.S. penny. ""So getting to work with them, without breaking or losing them, was a breathtaking moment. And I mean that literally, because if I'm sitting at the microscope with my fossil and I sneeze or breathe too hard, it's gone.""
While rain frogs are widespread throughout North and Central America now, these findings suggest Florida was a first home, where they had interesting company. Other extinct animals from Live Oak SB-1A and Brooksville 2, the sites where rain frog fossils were found in abundance, included bear-dogs, bone-crushing dogs, a weasel-like carnivore, squirrels, beavers and rabbits.

Eleutherodactylus is by far the earliest known account of a Caribbean vertebrate spreading to Florida. Fossil evidence indicates there were rodents and salamanders that made the reverse trip, moving from North America to the Caribbean during the Oligocene and Miocene, but evidence for movement from the islands to Florida is scarce. Caribbean toads, snakes and lizards crossed over during the following epoch, the Miocene, but these records are inconclusive and require further study.
Vallejo-Pareja hopes the methodology and data created by her paper will help bolster frog paleontology research and expressed admiration for the good work that has already been done. We just need more of it, she said. She created digital 3D models of the fossil bones used in the study, generating more information for people interested in the field. Paleontologists might find a frog bone and not realize what it is, she said. Now, they have an additional reference point.
In the future, Vallejo-Pareja wants to use some of the methods she developed in this study to understand how frogs adapt to environmental changes. Although frogs have managed to survive a number of major extinction events, they are very responsive to changes in variables like temperature and precipitation.
""What happened to the frogs during a glacial maximum?"" she asked. ""Were they smaller or bigger? Did they decrease or increase in diversity? Did they survive? It would be very nice to take a look into the past and see how frogs responded.""
The Florida Museum's Edward Stanley, Jonathan Bloch and David Blackburn also co-authored the study.

The distribution of salt by ocean currents plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate. This is what researchers from Dalhousie University in Canada, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and MARUM -- Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen have found in a new study. They studied natural climate anomalies, including the so-called Little Ice Age. This cold period from the 15th to the mid-19th century led to poor harvests, famine and disease in Europe. Although the Little Ice Age is one of the most studied periods in recent history, the underlying climatic mechanisms remain controversial.

""Looking at recent, natural climate anomalies helps to understand the processes and mechanisms that human-induced global warming may trigger,"" says Dr Anastasia Zhuravleva, lead author of the study. She was a PhD student at GEOMAR and received the Annette Barthelt Prize for her dissertation in 2019. She then worked as a post-doctoral researcher at GEOMAR and Dalhousie University, where the study was completed.
""Researchers often consider an increase in sea ice extent and desalination in the subpolar North Atlantic as possible triggers for past cold periods, but processes in the tropical Atlantic appear to be equally important,"" says Dr Zhuravleva. ""In fact, in contrast to the northern and mid-latitudes, there is little information on these recent climate events from the subtropical-tropical Atlantic and their impact on regions in the Northern Hemisphere,"" adds Dr Henning Bauch, paleoclimatologist at AWI and GEOMAR, co-initiator and co-author of the study. ""This is where our research comes in.""
So, what happened in the tropical Atlantic during historical climate anomalies, and how might potential changes there have affected ocean circulation and climate much further north? To answer these questions, the team worked on a sediment profile from the southern Caribbean and reconstructed the salinity and temperature of the surface water over the last 1700 years. Among other things, the researchers determined the isotopic and elemental composition of the calcareous shells of plankton.
The results show a cooling of about 1°C during the Little Ice Age. ""It is a significant temperature change for this region,"" says Dr Mahyar Mohtadi, co-author of the study and head of the Low Latitude Climate Variability group at MARUM. ""Particularly noteworthy is the occurrence of another pronounced cooling for the 8th-9th centuries. Colder temperatures in the otherwise warm tropical ocean led to lower regional rainfall, which coincided with severe droughts in the Yucatan Peninsula and the decline of the Classic Maya culture.""
In addition, the researchers found that the cold climate anomalies in the subpolar North Atlantic and Europe were accompanied by weaker ocean circulation and increased salinity in the Caribbean. ""Advection, or the movement of tropical salt to high northern latitudes, is essential for maintaining high surface densities in the subpolar North Atlantic. This is a prerequisite for the overall stability of the large-scale ocean circulation, including the transfer of warm Gulf Stream water, which is responsible for our mild temperatures in Europe,"" says Dr Bauch.
The data on the historical past thus allow a reconstruction of the connection across the North Atlantic. Initial cooling can be caused by volcanic eruptions, low solar activity and feedbacks between sea ice and the ocean in the north. The new study provides evidence that a decrease in salt movement to high northern latitudes will amplify and prolong these climate events. Conversely, the slow movement of positive salinity anomalies from the tropics will eventually increase the density at the surface of the subpolar North Atlantic. This may favour the northward transport of heat by ocean currents, resulting in milder temperatures over Europe and North America.
""Such a salinity feedback is known from models and has been assumed for the Little Ice Age. However, in the absence of tropical ocean data, these assumptions have been based on less direct precipitation records,"" says Dr Zhuravleva.
There is evidence that the Gulf Stream is weakening and that human-induced warming is a likely cause. What is certain is that the consequences of this change will be global. The extent to which the different climate mechanisms interact has been an open question. This study now confirms that the south-north transport of salt is a key factor in the processes involved.

Here, we reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity in the Caribbean Basin for the past 1700 years using the isotopic and elemental composition of planktic foraminifera tests. Centennial-scale SST and salinity variations in the Caribbean co-occur with (hydro)climate changes in the Northern Hemisphere and are linked to a North Atlantic SST forcing. Cold phases around 600, 800, and 1400 to 1600 C.E. are characterized by Caribbean salinification and Gulf of Mexico freshening that implies reductions in the strength of North Atlantic surface circulation. We suggest that the associated changes in the meridional salt advection contributed to the historical climate variability of the C.E."

During the last ice age, the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago, the climate in the North Atlantic underwent much greater multi-centennial variability than it does in the present warm period. This is supported by evidence found in ice and seafloor cores. Researchers at MARUM -- Center for Marine Environmental Sciences and the Department of Geosciences at the University of Bremen, and at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (The Netherlands) have now shown for the first time, based on a climate model, that internal mechanisms such as temperature and salinity distribution in the ocean are driving this multi-centennial variability. Their results are now published in the journal Science Advances.

Although humankind is responsible for the current global climate warming, our planet has constantly been undergoing natural climate fluctuations throughout the past. Possible forcing mechanisms for this variability would have been changes in the brightness of the sun or explosive volcanic eruptions, but also interactions within the atmosphere/ocean/sea-ice system. Experts refer here to external and internal factors influencing the climate system. The duration of such an oscillation, also called variability, can vary considerably.
Such climate variability is particularly important in climate research, especially for further improving our understanding of the effects of current anthropogenic climate change. However, with a few exceptions, there has long been a certain lack of clarity about climate oscillations that last for centuries. Dr. Matthias Prange, first author of the study and Earth System modeler at MARUM and the Geosciences Department, explains, ""Natural climate variability at time scales of hundreds of years is not yet well understood. For one, there are no observation time series that cover such long time periods. For another, there are only a few records of proxy data with sufficient resolution to shed light at this time scale. It has also been problematic that climate models to date have had great difficulty in depicting natural climate variability at time scales from 100 to 1,000 years.""
Natural climate variability during peak glacial period four times stronger
The models have continued to improve in recent years, however, and the scientists working with Matthias Prange have now been able to use a well-tested climate model to take a closer look at natural climate variability on a time scale of 100 to 1,000 years during the last peak glacial period. Available paleodata from ice and seafloor cores show that the natural climate variability intensified during the period between 23,000 and 19,000 years, and was globally as much as four times stronger than in the present Holocene. It was especially prominent in the North Atlantic. ""The fact that we now have climate models that can depict such changes in natural climate variability is a reflection of the great advances in climate modeling, and demonstrates the impressive capabilities of the models,"" according to Prange.
Searching for factors for internal forcing 
There is no evidence for external forcing for the multi-centennial climate variability. In the search for other causes the scientists turned their attention to possible internal mechanisms. ""We used the well-known Community Earth System Model, CESM1.2. for short, which is also used for predictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and fed it with the boundary conditions for the last ice age,"" says Prange. ""We input the level of greenhouse-gas concentration, the extent of continental ice distribution, and the characteristic orbital parameters for the time.""
Salt and temperature

When the ice age was at its peak and most pronounced, the scientists were able to detect a spontaneous oscillation in the North Atlantic lasting several hundred years, accompanied by fluctuations in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). One cycle, in which the AMOC becomes stronger and then weaker, lasts around 400 years. This involves the transport of low-salinity water from the South to the North Atlantic. Along the way it becomes even less saline, so that the seawater becomes lighter and does not sink as effectively into the depths of the North Atlantic. The production of deep water and its transportation toward the South Atlantic therefore becomes weaker.
The cyclic process is self-sustained, as the weakening of the AMOC results in less low-salinity water being transported northward again from the South Atlantic. Consequently, salinity in the North Atlantic may increase again, resulting in the production of more deep water. As Matthias Prange explains, ""These processes indicate that the multi-centennial climate variability is closely related to differences in the salinity and temperature in the water column."" And although the amplitudes of the variation are low, there are clear effects on the extent of North Atlantic sea ice and on the temperatures in Greenland. ""The average annual temperatures there vary by about four degrees Celsius as a result of the AMOC oscillations,"" concludes Prange.
High-resolution paleodata
In order to support these findings of the models, the scientists investigated the sea-surface temperatures for that time period. ""To do this, we compiled and analyzed all of the high-resolution reconstructions from marine sediments of the North Atlantic,"" says Dr. Lukas Jonkers, co-author of the study and micropaleontologist at MARUM. ""High-resolution here means that the data points of a series average no more than 200 years apart, with no single step greater than 1000 years."" The paleoarchives studied provide evidence for recurring temperature oscillations in the surface waters every 150 to 1000 years during the last glacial maximum, which is consistent with the modelled multi-centennial climate variability with internal forcing mechanisms.
The importance of understanding feedback processes
Recent research findings underscore the importance of detailed study and understanding of feedback processes in the climate system. Matthias Prange emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of climate variability at various time scales, as this could have ramifications for future climate change that could lead to unexpected and undesirable surprises for societies. These findings are also incorporated into the work of the Cluster of Excellence ""The Ocean Floor -- Earth's Uncharted Interface,"" which is based at MARUM.

As there was no obvious change in external forcing, causes for the increased variability remain unknown. Exploiting LGM simulations with a comprehensive coupled climate model along with high-resolution proxy records, we introduce an oscillatory mode of multicentennial variability, which is associated with moderate variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and depends on the large-scale salinity distribution. This self-sustained mode is amplified by sea-ice feedbacks and induces maximum surface temperature variability in the subpolar North Atlantic region. Characterized by a distinct climatic imprint and different dynamics, the multicentennial oscillation has to be distinguished from Dansgaard-Oeschger variability and emerges only under full LGM climate forcing. The potential of multicentennial modes of variability to emerge or disappear in response to changing climate forcing may have implications for future climate change."

Things may not have ended well for dinosaurs on Earth, but Cornell University astronomers say the ""light fingerprint"" of the conditions that enabled them to emerge here provide a crucial missing piece in our search for signs of life on planets orbiting alien stars.

Their analysis of the most recent 540 million years of Earth's evolution, known as the Phanerozoic Eon, finds that telescopes could better detect potential chemical signatures of life in the atmosphere of an Earth-like exoplanet more closely resembling the age the dinosaurs inhabited than the one we know today.
Two key biosignature pairs -- oxygen and methane, and ozone and methane -- appeared stronger in models of Earth roughly 100 million to 300 million years ago, when oxygen levels were significantly higher. The models simulated the transmission spectra, or light fingerprint, generated by an atmosphere that absorbs some colors of starlight and lets others filter through, information scientists use to determine the atmosphere's composition.
""Modern Earth's light fingerprint has been our template for identifying potentially habitable planets, but there was a time when this fingerprint was even more pronounced -- better at showing signs of life,"" said Lisa Kaltenegger, director of the Carl Sagan Institute (CSI) and associate professor of astronomy. ""This gives us hope that it might be just a little bit easier to find signs of life -- even large, complex life -- elsewhere in the cosmos.""
Kaltenegger is co-author of ""Oxygen Bounty for Earth-like Exoplanets: Spectra of Earth Through the Phanerozoic,"" published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters. First author, Rebecca Payne, research associate at CSI, led the new models that details a critical epoch including the origins of land plants, animals and dinosaurs.
Using estimates from two established climate models (called GEOCARB and COPSE), the researchers simulated Earth's atmospheric composition and resulting transmission spectra over five 100-million-year increments of the Phanerozoic. Each features significant changes as a complex ocean biosphere diversified, forests proliferated and terrestrial biospheres flourished, influencing the mix of oxygen and other gasses in the atmosphere.
""It's only the most recent 12% or so of Earth's history, but it encompasses pretty much all of the time in which life was more complex than sponges,"" said Payne. ""These light fingerprints are what you'd search for elsewhere, if you were looking for something more advanced than a single-celled organism.""
While similar evolutionary processes may or may not unfold on exoplanets, Payne and Kaltenegger said their models fill in a missing puzzle piece of what a Phanerozoic would look like to a telescope, creating new templates for habitable planets with varying atmospheric oxygen levels.

Kaltenegger pioneered modeling of what Earth would look like to faraway observers based on changes over time in its geology, climate and atmosphere -- our ""ground truth,"" she said, for identifying potential evidence of life on other worlds.
To date, about 35 rocky exoplanets have been discovered in habitable zones where liquid water could exist, Kaltenegger said. Analyzing an exoplanet's atmosphere -- if it has one -- is at the edge of technical capability for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope but is now a possibility. But, the researchers said, scientists need to know what to look for. Their models identify planets like Phanerozoic Earth as the most promising targets for finding life in the cosmos.
They also allow scientists to entertain the possibility -- purely theoretical -- that if a habitable exoplanet is discovered to have an atmosphere with 30% oxygen, life there might not be limited to microbes, but could include creatures as large and varied as the megalosauruses or microraptors that once roamed Earth.
""If they're out there,"" Payne said, ""this sort of analysis lets us figure out where they could be living.""
Dinosaurs or not, the models confirm that from a great distance, such a planet's light fingerprint would stand out more than a modern Earth's.

The chance discovery of a note written in a 15th century Hebrew prayer book fills an important gap in the historical Italian earthquake record, offering a brief glimpse of a previously unknown earthquake affecting the Marche region in the central Apennines.

Paolo Galli, who found the note in the Apostolic Vatican Library while looking for contemporaneous accounts of another historic Italian earthquake, writes in Seismological Research Letters that the note ""not only helps us partially fill a gap in the seismic history of Italy but also prompts us to reflect on how we still do not know about seismogenesis even in times covered by written sources.""
""The wealth of historical sources in Italy is undoubtedly one of the richest, but it is equally subject to gaps both in terms of time and in places,"" said Galli. ""Unlike the Kingdom of Naples, for example, the production of documentation related to earthquakes has certainly been poorer in the Papal States, of which the Marche Region was a part in the 15th century.""
The note discovered by Galli was written on the leaf of the prayer book, which was copied in the Marche town of Camerino and completed in September-October 1446. The eight lines of the note describe an earthquake around Camerino that knocked down houses, the governor's courtyard, and destroyed cities and villages ""that have become a mound of stone.""
Men and women ""come here in Camerino dressed in white pale dresses with their horses and mules and donkeys loaded with bread and food and wine, in order to hold the hand of the poor,"" the note relates, while stating that the earthquakes in the area continued from March to September.
The note is the only evidence of a damaging earthquake in the Marche region from the 15th century. Galli said a 1446 petition asking for funds to restore city walls and a castle in Petrino, a settlement 20 kilometers away from Camerino, may be the only other possible written indication of a damaging earthquake in the region.
There are only 450 documented earthquake site observations from Italy for the 15th century, and about half of those observations come from a key historic earthquake sequence in 1456 in the south-central Apennines. Galli had been looking through the library's manuscripts from the Middle Ages to find more information about this sequence when he came across the prayer book.

""The earthquake of 1456, or rather, the earthquakes of 1456, represent the most catastrophic seismic sequence that occurred in the late Middle Ages in central-southern Italy,"" he explained. ""Despite the abundance of historical sources, particularly a specific treatise on the earthquake written by the famous humanist Giannozzo Manetti, we still do not have certainties about the different epicentral areas and, therefore, the parameters of individual mainshocks -- magnitude and epicenter -- and their seismic sources.""
The damage described in the prayer book note suggests that Camerino may have experienced intense shaking, measuring about an 8 on the Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg intensity scale, Galli said. This level implies severe damage and partial collapse to half of the town's buildings, along with the fall of columns, monuments and walls.
Galli suggested the Camerino earthquake might have been a ""twin"" to a 1799 sequence in the region, where a magnitude 6.2 earthquake caused similar intense shaking.
""Of course, this is only a hypothesis, but by comparing the epicentral area and the level of damage in Camerino and its surroundings, it is possible that the effects described in our manuscript describe, albeit briefly, something similar to the event of 1799,"" Galli noted.
""In particular, the manuscript mentions that many settlements around Camerino were reduced to piles of stones, indicating that the epicentral area was possibly the same as in 1799,"" he added. ""Similarly, the absence of information in the far field suggests that the earthquake was likely caused by a shallow-depth fault, as probably occurred in 1799.""

Carnivorous dinosaurs might have evolved to take advantage of giant carcasses, according to a study published November 1, 2023 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Cameron Pahl and Luis Ruedas of Portland State University, Oregon and colleagues.

Carnivorous dinosaurs lived in ecosystems rich with both living and dead prey. The authors hypothesize that giant carcasses, like those of sauropod dinosaurs, might have provided a major source of food for large carnivores. To test this hypothesis, the researchers created an agent-based model, a simplified virtual simulation of a dinosaur ecosystem. This model was based on the ancient fauna of the Jurassic-aged Morrison Formation, which included large predators like Allosaurus alongside large sauropods, their carcasses, and an infinite supply of huntable stegosaurs.
In the model, carnivores (intended to simulate allosaurs) were assigned traits that would improve their hunting or scavenging abilities while obtaining energy from meat sources (simulating living prey or sauropod carcasses). The model measured the evolutionary fitness of these simulated carnivores and found that, when large sources of sauropod carrion were available, scavenging was more profitable than hunting, suggesting that carnivores in such ecosystems might have evolved specialized traits to help them detect and exploit large carcasses.
The authors stress that this model represents a simplified abstract of a complex system, and that the results might be altered with the inclusion of more variables, such as additional dinosaur species or features of the life history of the simulated dinosaurs. They note that models like this might improve our understanding of how the availability of carrion can influence the evolution of predators.
The authors add: ""Our evolutionary model demonstrates that large theropods such as Allosaurus could have evolved to subsist on sauropod carrion as their primary resource. Even when huntable prey was available to them, selection pressure favored the scavengers, while the predators suffered from lower fitness. So we think allosaurs probably waited until a bunch of sauropods died in the dry season, feasted on their carcasses, stored the fat in their tails, then waited until the next season to repeat the process. This makes sense logically too, because a single sauropod carcass had enough calories to sustain 25 or so allosaurs for weeks or even months, and sauropods were often the most abundant dinosaurs in the environment.""

We wrote an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate meat energy sources present in dinosaur environments, including carcasses of giant sauropods, along with living, huntable prey. Theropod dinosaurs modeled in this environment (specifically allosauroids, and more particularly, Allosaurus Marsh, 1877) were instantiated with heritable traits favorable to either hunting success or scavenging success. If hunter phenotypes were more reproductively successful, their traits were propagated into the population through their offspring, resulting in predator specialists. If selective pressure favored scavenger phenotypes, the population would evolve to acquire most of their calories from carrion. Data generated from this model strongly suggest that theropods in sauropod-dominated systems evolved to detect carcasses, consume and store large quantities of fat, and dominate carcass sites. Broadly speaking, selective forces did not favor predatory adaptations, because sauropod carrion resource pools, as we modeled them, were too profitable for prey-based resource pools to be significant. This is the first research to test selective pressure patterns in dinosaurs, and the first to estimate theropod mass based on metabolic constraints."

A new analysis of the bones and muscles in ancient fish gives new clues about how the shoulder evolved in animals -- including us.

The shoulder girdle -- the configuration of bones and muscles that in humans support the movement of the arms -- is a classic example of an evolutionary 'novelty'. This is where a new anatomical feature appears without any obvious precursors; where there is no smoking gun of which feature clearly led to another.
The new research, which draws together a range of evolutionary investigation techniques including fossils, developmental biology, and comparative anatomy, suggests a new way of looking at how major anatomical features like shoulders evolved.
The results of the study, led by Imperial College London's Dr Martin Brazeau and Natural History Museum researchers, are published today in Nature.
One theory of the shoulder's origin is that it was part of how fins formed in pairs on either side of the fish body, the evolution of which allowed fish more swimming control and eventually spurred the move from water to land. The 'gill-arch' hypothesis suggests that these fins evolved from the bony 'loops' that support the gills, which also formed the shoulder. However, it has been difficult to gather any evidence for this hypothesis, as the features are rarely preserved in fossils.
A different theory of how the fins formed, the 'fin-fold' hypothesis, suggests the precursors of the paired fins instead evolved out of a line of muscle on the flanks of the fish. This theory has gained a lot of supportive evidence in the 150 years since both were proposed, but it cannot explain how the associated shoulder girdle evolved.
Now, by reanalysing an ancient fossil fish skull from soon after the shoulder girdle emerged, alongside other lines of evidence, the team suggest the truth may lie in a modified version of the gill-arch hypothesis that reconciles it with the fin-fold hypothesis.

The fossil the team looked at is a placoderm, of the species Kolymaspis sibirica, which lived around 407 million years ago and was among earliest jaw-bearing fishes. The fossil has a well-preserved brain case -- the hard inner parts of the skull that record imprints and other features of the brain.
Dr Brazeau realised that despite the poor or absent preservation of the gill arches in such fossils, evidence for them could be well preserved in the brain case: the cartilaginous or bony 'box' that surrounds the brain and supports the sensory structures like eyes and ears. The brain case showed a curious head-shoulder joint highlighted by the configuration of muscles and blood vessels.
By comparing this feature in the jawed fish fossil with the brain case features of their precursors, the jawless fish, he and the team discovered new ways the two could be compared. They found the unusual head-shoulder joint bears similarities with the gill arches in earlier fish, suggesting it was these that were retained and incorporated into the formation of the shoulder at an early stage.
While most jawless fish have 5-20 gill arches, jawed fish almost never have more than five. Combining this with the new brain-case evidence, the team suggest the sixth gill arch was incorporated into the shoulder, becoming a crucial boundary that separated the head from the body. Intriguingly, the blood supply to the fins of jawless fishes emerges between the sixth and seventh gill arches.
Dr Brazeau, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said: ""The gill arches seem to have been involved in the early separation of the head and body via the shoulder. But we no longer have gill arches -- though the shoulder was templated on them, they don't need to still be around today.
""This is consistent with some earlier studies that showed muscles can remain highly stable, while the specific bones that support them gradually take over one from the other. Gill arches may have done their part and been replaced as the shoulder took on a new configuration, including supporting things like our necks.""
This finding also means it doesn't have to be an either/or in terms of how the paired fins evolved. Dr Brazeau added: ""Our study shows how there is merit to both theories without accepting one or the other wholesale. Instead, we can rationalise the areas that overlap.""
Dr Zerina Johnson, Researcher at the Natural History Museum, adds: ""The team will next focus on specimens from the Natural History Museum's fossil fish collection. This will include jawless fish that have fins but lack a distinct shoulder girdle.
""We are currently processing many gigabytes worth of data, and I can hardly wait to see what these important specimens from the collection will add to the story.""

Paired appendages are widely considered as key innovations that enabled new opportunities for controlled swimming and gill ventilation and were prerequisites for the eventual transition from water to land. The past 150 years of debate8–10 has been shaped by two contentious theories4,5: the ventrolateral fin-fold hypothesis9,10 and the archipterygium hypothesis8. The latter proposes that fins and girdles evolved from an ancestral gill arch. Although studies in animal development have revived interest in this idea11–13, it is apparently unsupported by fossil evidence. Here we present palaeontological support for a pharyngeal basis for the vertebrate shoulder girdle. We use computed tomography scanning to reveal details of the braincase of Kolymaspis sibirica14, an Early Devonian placoderm fish from Siberia, that suggests a pharyngeal component of the shoulder. We combine these findings with refreshed comparative anatomy of placoderms and jawless outgroups to place the origin of the shoulder girdle on the sixth branchial arch. These findings provide a novel framework for understanding the origin of the pectoral girdle. Our evidence clarifies the location of the presumptive head–trunk interface in jawless fishes and explains the constraint on branchial arch number in gnathostomes15. The results revive a key aspect of the archipterygium hypothesis and help reconcile it with the ventrolateral fin-fold model."

A collaboration led by Northumbria University and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences has for the first time mapped how land use changed across Britain throughout the last century. The new map reveals how and where some 50 per cent of semi-natural grassland was lost, including 90 per cent of the country's lowland meadows and pasture, as the nation intensified its agriculture.

The researchers used the new map to investigate the impacts of land use change and climate change on the flora and fauna of Britain. Assembling a large citizen science dataset of some 1,192 species and over 20 million distribution records, they determined how often these factors 'interact' -- potentially exacerbating each other to drive contractions in species' geographic ranges.
According to the research findings, interactions between these factors were relatively rare, affecting less than one in five species. Where they did occur, their combined effect on extinction risk was often weak. Overall, the researchers found that 16 per cent of species were negatively affected by climate warming, land conversion or both, being more likely to disappear from areas where such changes have taken place.
Finding that species' responses to environmental change were highly individual, or 'idiosyncratic', the researchers concluded that it was difficult to generalise across the taxonomic groups they studied (plants, birds, butterflies, and moths). They highlight a need to include species-specific information in efforts to mitigate climate change impacts or the extinction crisis.
Dr Andrew Suggitt, an ecologist from the Department of Geography and Environmental Sciences at Northumbria University who co-led the research, said: ""We've known for a while that the two most prominent drivers of biodiversity loss -- land use change and climate change -- can interact to worsen each other's effect on species. But until now we have lacked digital maps of land use that go back far enough to cover the substantial changes associated with the intensification of agriculture that peaked in the mid-20th century, when semi-natural grasslands were converted, hedgerows were removed, and more land was brought into production.
""Our map allowed us to test for interactions between climate change and land use change during this important episode of upheaval in the mid-to-late 20th century. We found that these factors don't often interact to drive range retractions, which is good news, but the highly individual character of the responses will mean that we need to include species-level information in policies aimed at climate change adaptation or biodiversity goals.""
Dr Alistair Auffret, an ecologist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences who also co-led the research, said: ""Semi-natural pastures and meadows are hotspots of biodiversity across Europe, and we were sadly not surprised by the extent of their loss in Britain during the 20th century. Our results showed that retaining these habitats was important for reducing local losses in specialist species, but it remains the case that many such species are under threat. Conserving and restoring natural and semi-natural habitat in line with international agreements and targets should be a priority going forward.""

Pairing this dataset with climate change data, we tested for relationships to distribution changes in birds, butterflies, macromoths, and plants (n = 1192 species total). We show that individual or additive effects of climate warming and land conversion unambiguously increased persistence probability for 40% of species, and decreased it for 12%, and these effects were reflected in both range contractions and expansions.

A recent study found some of the oldest animals in the world living in a place you wouldn't expect: fishes in the Arizona desert. Researchers found the second genus of animal ever for which three or more species have known lifespans greater than 100 years, which could open the doors to aging studies across disciplines, such as gerontology and senescence (aging) among vertebrates.

The study centers around a series of fish species within the Ictiobus genus, known as buffalofishes. Minnesota has native populations of each of the three species studied: bigmouth buffalo, smallmouth buffalo and black buffalo. The importance of this research is underscored by the fact that these fishes are often misidentified and lumped in with invasive species, like carp, and the fishing regulations in many places, including Minnesota, do not properly protect these species, and what could become a wealth of information about longevity and aging.
This new research from the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD), recently published in Scientific Reports, was a collaboration between Alec Lackmann, PhD, an ichthyologist and assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of the Swenson College of Science and Engineering at UMD; other scientists including from North Dakota State University; and a group of conservation anglers who fish the Apache Lake reservoir in Arizona.
""There is likely a treasure trove of aging, longevity and negligible senescence information within the genus Ictiobus,"" said Lackmann. ""This study brings light to this potential and opens the door to a future in which a more complete understanding of the process of vertebrate aging can be realized, including for humans. The research begs the question: what is the buffalofishes' fountain of youth?""
Lackmann has studied buffalofishes before, and his research from 2019 went so far as to extend the previously thought maximum age of bigmouth buffalo from around 25 years of age, to more than 100 years of age by applying and validating a far more refined aging technique than had been used previously. Instead of examining the fish's scale, ""you extract what are called the otoliths, or earstones, from inside the cranium of the fish, and then thin section the stones to determine their age,"" said Lackmann.
Approximately 97 percent of fish species have otoliths. They're tiny stone-like structures that grow throughout the fish's lifetime, forming a new layer each year. When processed properly, scientists like Lackmann can examine the otolith with a compound microscope and count the layers, like the rings on a tree, and learn the age of the fish.
Results of the study include: Unparalleled longevity for freshwater fishes. Namely, three species with lifespans more than a century, with greater than 90 percent of the buffalofishes in Apache Lake more than 85 years old. The discovery that some of the original buffalofishes from the Arizona stocking in 1918 are likely still alive. A fishery of catch-and-release buffalofish angling that has not only increased our knowledge of fisheries, but also our understanding of how buffalofishes can be identified and recaptured across years, including uniquely-marked centenarians. A robust citizens and scientists collaborative effort that has resulted in thorough and consistent scientific outreach and learning.Buffalofishes are native to central North America, including Minnesota, but those in this recent study were found in Apache Lake, a reservoir in the desert southwest. Originally reared in hatcheries and rearing ponds along the Mississippi River in the Midwest, the government stocked buffalofishes into Roosevelt Lake (upstream of Apache Lake), Arizona in 1918. While Roosevelt Lake was fished commercially, Apache Lake's fish populations remained largely untouched until anglers recently learned how to consistently catch buffalofishes there on rod-and-line.

When these catch-and-release conservation anglers noticed unique orange and black spots on many of the fish they were catching, they wanted to learn more about the markings, and found Lackmann's previous research. An Arizona angler, Stuart Black, reached out and invited Lackmann to a fishing expedition at Apache Lake, where the fish collected would be donated to science.
By studying the fishes collected at the angling event and analyzing their otoliths for age, Lackmann found that some of the buffalofishes from the 1918 Arizona stocking are likely still alive today, and that most of the buffalofishes in Apache Lake hatched during the early 1920s. More importantly, they discovered that the three different buffalofish species found in the lake had ages more than 100 years. To their knowledge, such longevity across multiple freshwater fish species is found nowhere else in the world.
For Lackmann, there are exciting possibilities for the future of studying this unique group of fish, with far-reaching implications.
""These long-lived species of fishes and individuals could be monitored so that we can further study and understand their DNA, their physiology, their ability to fight infection and disease, and to compare these systems across the continuum of age,"" said Lackmann. ""The genus Ictiobus has potential to prove of high value to the field of gerontology, and Apache Lake could become an epicenter for a variety of scientific research in the future.""

A research team led by the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE) and Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) has identified the most widespread genetic contribution by Denisovans to date. The study reveals that the genetic variant observed, which affects zinc regulation, could have signified an evolutionary advantage in our ancestors' adaptation to the cold. The study, published by PLoS Genetics, also reveals that this genetic adaptation may have predisposed modern humans to neuropsychiatric disorders.

Modern humans left Africa some 60,000 years ago in the event known as ""Out-of-Africa."" In Asia, they coincided with the Denisovans, and that encounter may have led to confrontations and collaborations, but also various crossbreeding. In fact, even today modern humans retain genetic variants of Denisovan origin in our genome, which are testimony to those initial interactions.
Now, a team led by the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE), a joint centre of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), and by the UPF Department of Medicine and Life Sciences (MELIS), has identified one of the most widespread traces of the genetic heritage of the extinct Denisovans in modern humans. The teams of Elena Bosch, IBE principal investigator, and of Rubén Vicente, MELIS-UPF principal investigator, have discovered that this genetic adaptation helped ancestral populations of sapiens to adapt to the cold.
The variant observed, involved in zinc regulation and with a role in cellular metabolism, could also have predisposed modern humans to psychiatric disorders such as depression or schizophrenia.
Genetic variation in zinc regulation may have meant an evolutionary advantage
How adaptation has shaped current genetic diversity in human populations is a matter of great interest in evolutionary genetics.
Arising from this question, Elena Bosch's team identified an adaptive variant among current human populations in a region of our genome that bears great similarity to the genome of an extinct ancestral population: the Denisovans.

""Through genomic analysis, we noted that the genetic variant observed came from our interbreeding with archaic humans in the past, possibly the Denisovans,"" says Ana Roca-Umbert, co-first author of the study. The team has ruled out Neanderthal heritage, since these populations do not have this mutation.
""Apparently, the change was beneficial and proved a selective advantage for humans. As a consequence, this variation in the SLC30A9 gene was selected and has reached current populations,"" adds Jorge Garcia-Calleja, co-first author of the study.
The Evolutionary Population Genetics Laboratory, directed by Bosch, wished to find out what changes are brought about by this genetic variation of Denisovan origin at the cellular level. ""We discovered that this mutation surely had implications for the transport of zinc within the cell, and so we contacted Vicente's team,"" recalls Elena Bosch, IBE principal investigator and co-leader of the study.
Zinc regulation: key to adapting to the cold
""Elena contacted me because her team had observed a change in an amino acid in a zinc transporter, which was very different between the populations of Africa and Asia today. From there, we started asking ourselves questions and looking for answers,"" Rubén Vicente comments. His team, in the Biophysics of the Immune System group at the Laboratory of Molecular Physiology, undertook the technical challenge of studying the movement of intracellular zinc.
Zinc, an essential trace element for human health, is an important messenger that transfers both information from the outside to the inside of cells and between different cellular compartments. A lack of zinc causes growth, neurological and immune disorders, although ""its regulation is still poorly studied due to the lack of molecular tools to follow the flow of zinc.""
Vicente's laboratory identified that the observed variant causes a new zinc balance within the cell, promoting a change in metabolism. By altering the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of the cells, this variation causes a possible metabolic advantage to cope with a hostile climate. ""The observed phenotype leads us to think of a possible adaptation to the cold,"" Vicente asserts.

The Denisovan genetic heritage could affect the mental health of European and Asian populations
Zinc transport is also involved in nervous system excitability, and plays a role in people's mental equilibrium and health.
The team points out that the variant found in this zinc transporter, which is expressed in all tissues of the body, is associated with a greater predisposition to suffering from some psychiatric diseases. These include anorexia nervosa, hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia.
""In the future, expanding this study to animal models could shed light on this predisposition to suffering from mental illnesses,"" Vicente notes.
The genetic variant has left a global mark, except in Africa
Although the variant was established in Asia as a result of interbreeding between Denisovans and sapiens, it also spread to European and native American populations. In fact, it is found in populations all over the planet, although, in the case of African populations, it is much less frequent.
The team points out that it is probably the Denisovan genetic adaptation to have the greatest geographical scope discovered to date. ""For example, a variant in the EPAS1 gene inherited from the Denisovans allows adapting to life at altitude, but is found only in Tibetans. However, in our case, the impact extends to all populations outside Africa,"" Bosch concludes.

However, no direct adaptive molecular phenotype has been demonstrated. Our results provide evidence for directional selection operating in two major complementary haplotypes in Africa and East Asia. These haplotypes are associated with differential gene expression but also differ in the Met50Val substitution (rs1047626) in ZnT9, which we show is found in homozygosis in the Denisovan genome and displays accompanying signatures suggestive of archaic introgression. Although we found no significant differences in systemic zinc content between individuals with different rs1047626 genotypes, we demonstrate that the expression of the derived isoform (ZnT9 50Val) in HEK293 cells shows a gain of function when compared with the ancestral (ZnT9 50Met) variant. Notably, the ZnT9 50Val variant was found associated with differences in zinc handling by the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, with an impact on mitochondrial metabolism. Given the essential role of the mitochondria in skeletal muscle and since the derived allele at rs1047626 is known to be associated with greater susceptibility to several neuropsychiatric traits, we propose that adaptation to cold may have driven this selection event, while also impacting predisposition to neuropsychiatric disorders in modern humans."

A new Antarctic ice sheet modeling study from scientists at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography suggests that meltwater flowing out to sea from beneath Antarctic glaciers is making them lose ice faster.

The model's simulations suggest this effect is large enough to make a meaningful contribution to global sea-level rise under high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.
The extra ice loss caused by this meltwater flowing out to sea from beneath Antarctic glaciers is not currently accounted for in the models generating major sea-level rise projections, such as those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). If this process turns out to be an important driver of ice loss across the entire Antarctic ice sheet, it could mean current projections underestimate the pace of global sea-level rise in decades to come.
""Knowing when and how much global sea-level will rise is critical to the welfare of coastal communities,"" said Tyler Pelle, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at Scripps. ""Millions of people live in low-lying coastal zones and we can't adequately prepare our communities without accurate sea-level rise projections.""
The study, published October 27 in Science Advances and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA, and the Cecil H. and the Ida M. Green Foundation for Earth Sciences at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at Scripps, modeled the retreat of two glaciers in East Antarctica through the year 2300 under different emissions scenarios and projected their contributions to sea-level rise. Unlike previous Antarctic ice sheet models, this one included the influence of this flow of meltwater from beneath glaciers out to sea, which is known as subglacial discharge.
The two glaciers the study focused on, named Denman and Scott, together hold enough ice to cause nearly 1.5 meters (5 feet) of sea-level rise. In a high emissions scenario (IPCC's SSP5-8.5 scenario, which assumes no new climate policy and features 20% higher CO2 emissions by 2100), the model found that subglacial discharge increased the sea-level rise contribution of these glaciers by 15.7%, from 19 millimeters (0.74 inches) to 22 millimeters (0.86 inches) by the year 2300.
These glaciers, which are right next to each other, sit atop a continental trench that is more than two miles deep; once their retreat reaches the trench's steep slope, their contribution to sea-level rise is expected to accelerate dramatically. With the added influence of subglacial discharge, the model found that the glaciers retreated past this threshold about 25 years earlier than they did without it.

""I think this paper is a wake up call for the modeling community. It shows you can't accurately model these systems without taking this process into account,"" said Jamin Greenbaum, co-author of the study and a researcher at Scripps' Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics.
A key takeaway, beyond the understudied role of subglacial discharge in accelerating sea-level rise, is the importance of what humanity does in the coming decades to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, said Greenbaum. The low emissions scenario runs of the model did not show the glaciers retreating all the way into the trench and avoided the resulting runaway contributions to sea-level rise.
""If there is a doomsday story here it isn't subglacial discharge,"" said Greenbaum. ""The real doomsday story is still emissions and humanity is still the one with its finger on the button.""
In Antarctica, subglacial meltwater is generated from melting that occurs where the ice sits on continental bedrock. The main sources of the heat melting the ice in contact with the ground are friction from the ice grinding across the bedrock and geothermal heat from Earth's interior permeating up through the crust.
Prior research suggested that subglacial meltwater is a common feature of glaciers around the world and that it is present under several other massive Antarctic glaciers, including the infamous Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica.
When subglacial discharge flows out to sea it is thought to accelerate melting of the glacier's ice shelf -- a long floating tongue of ice that extends out to sea beyond the last part of the glacier that is still in contact with solid ground (known as the grounding line). Subglacial discharge is thought to speed up ice shelf melting and glacial retreat by causing ocean mixing that stirs in additional ocean heat within the cavity beneath a glacier's floating ice shelf. This enhanced ice shelf melting then causes the upstream glacier to accelerate, which can drive sea level rise.

The notion that subglacial discharge causes additional ice shelf melting is widely accepted in the scientific community, said Greenbaum. But it hasn't been included in sea-level rise projections because many researchers weren't sure if the process' effect was sufficiently large to increase sea-level rise, mainly because its effects are localized around the glacier's ice shelf.
Pelle said subglacial discharge came onto his radar in 2021 when he and his colleagues observed that East Antarctica's Denman Glacier's ice shelf was melting faster than expected given local ocean temperatures. Puzzlingly, Denman's neighbor Scott Glacier's ice shelf was melting much more slowly despite virtually identical ocean conditions.
To test whether subglacial discharge could reconcile the melt rates seen at the Denman and Scott ice shelves, as well as whether subglacial meltwater might accelerate sea-level rise, the team combined models for three different environments: the ice sheet, the space between the ice sheet and bedrock, and the ocean.
Once the researchers married the three models into one they ran a series of projections up to 2300 using a NASA supercomputer.
The projections featured three main scenarios: a control that featured no additional ocean warming, a low emissions pathway (SSP1-2.6), and a high emissions pathway (SSP5-8.5). For each scenario, the researchers created projections with and without the effect of present-day levels of subglacial discharge.
The model's simulations revealed that adding in subglacial discharge reconciled the melt rates seen at Denman and Scott Glaciers. As for why Scott Glacier was melting so much slower than Denman, Pelle said the model showed that ""a strong subglacial discharge channel drained across the Denman Glacier grounding line, while a weaker discharge channel drained across the Scott Glacier grounding line."" The strength of the discharge channel at Denman, Pelle explained, was behind its speedy melt.
For the control and low-emissions model runs the contributions to sea-level rise were close to zero or even slightly negative with or without subglacial discharge at 2300. But in a high emissions scenario, the model found that subglacial discharge increased the sea-level rise contribution of these glaciers from 19 millimeters (0.74 inches) to 22 millimeters (0.86 inches) in 2300.
In the high emissions scenario that included subglacial discharge, Denman and Scott Glaciers retreated into the two-mile-deep trench beneath them by 2240, about 25 years earlier than they did in the model runs without subglacial discharge. Once the grounding lines of the Denman and Scott Glaciers retreat past the lip of this trench their yearly sea-level rise contribution explodes, reaching a peak of 0.33 millimeters (0.01 inches) per year -- roughly half of the present-day annual sea-level rise contribution of the entire Antarctic ice sheet.
Pelle said the trench's steep slope is behind this explosive increase in sea-level rise contribution. As the glacier retreats down slope, its ice shelf begins losing thicker and thicker slabs of ice from its leading edge. This process of ice loss quickly outpaces ice accumulation at the ice sheet's interior, causing further glacial retreat. Researchers refer to this process as ""Marine Ice Sheet Instability,"" and it can promote explosive ice loss from glaciers like Denman and Scott.
Researchers refer to topography such as the trench beneath Denman and Scott Glaciers as a retrograde slope and worry that it creates a positive feedback loop by which glacial retreat begets more retreat. Large areas of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, such as Thwaites Glacier, also have retrograde slopes that, while not as dramatic as the Denman-Scott trench, contribute to fears of broader ice sheet instability.
""Subglacial meltwater has been inferred beneath most if not all Antarctic glaciers, including Thwaites, Pine Island, and Totten glaciers,"" said Pelle. ""All these glaciers are retreating and contributing to sea-level rise and we are showing that subglacial discharge could be accelerating their retreat. It's urgent that we model these other glaciers so we can get a handle on the magnitude of the effect subglacial discharge is having.""
The researchers behind this study are doing just that. Pelle said they are in the process of submitting a research proposal to extend their new model to the entire Antarctic ice sheet.
Future iterations of the model may also attempt to couple the subglacial environment with the ice sheet and ocean models so that the amount of subglacial meltwater dynamically responds to these other factors. Greenbaum said that the current version of their model kept the amount of subglacial meltwater constant throughout the model runs, and that making it respond dynamically to the surrounding environment would likely make the model more true to life.
""This also means that our results are probably a conservative estimate of the effect of subglacial discharge,"" said Greenbaum. ""That said, we can't yet say how much sea-level rise will be accelerated by this process -- hopefully it's not too much.""
Part of Greenbaum's upcoming fieldwork in Antarctica, supported by NSF and NASA, aims to directly investigate the impacts of subglacial meltwater in both the East and West Antarctic ice sheets. In collaboration with the Australian Antarctic Division and the Korea Polar Research Institute, Greenbaum and his collaborators will be visiting the ice shelves of Denman and Thwaites Glaciers in East and West Antarctica, respectively, looking for direct evidence that subglacial freshwater is discharging into the ocean beneath the glaciers' ice shelves and contributing to warming.
In addition to Pelle and Greenbaum, the study was co-authored by Christine Dow of the University of Waterloo, Adrian Jenkins of Northumbria University, and Mathieu Morlighem of Dartmouth College.

Two-thousand years ago, forts were constructed by the Roman Empire across the northern Fertile Crescent, spanning from what is now western Syria to northwestern Iraq.

In the 1920s, 116 forts were documented in the region by Father Antoine Poidebard, who conducted one of the world's first aerial surveys using a WWI-era biplane. Poidebard reported that the forts were constructed from north to south to establish an eastern boundary of the Roman Empire.
A new Dartmouth study analyzing declassified Cold War satellite imagery reveals 396 previously undocumented Roman forts and reports that these forts were constructed from east to west. The analysis refutes Poidebard's claim that the forts were located along a north-south axis by showing that the forts spanned from Mosul on the Tigris River to Aleppo in western Syria.
The results are published in Antiquity.
""I was surprised to find that there were so many forts and that they were distributed in this way because the conventional wisdom was that these forts formed the border between Rome and its enemies in the east, Persia or Arab armies,"" says lead author Jesse Casana, a professor in the Department of Anthropology and director of the Spatial Archaeometry Lab at Dartmouth. ""While there's been a lot of historical debate about this, it had been mostly assumed that this distribution was real, that Poidebard's map showed that the forts were demarcating the border and served to prevent movement across it in some way.""
For the study, the team drew on declassified Cold-War era CORONA and HEXAGON satellite imagery collected between 1960 and 1986. Most of the imagery is part of the open-access CORONA Atlas Project through which Casana and colleagues developed better methods for correcting the data and made it available online.
The researchers examined satellite imagery of approximately 300,000 square kilometers (115,831 square miles) of the northern Fertile Cresent. It is a place where sites show up particularly well and is archaeologically significant, according to Casana. The team mapped 4,500 known sites and then systematically documented every other site-like feature in each of the nearly 5 by 5 kilometer (3.1 mile by 3.1 mile) survey grids, which resulted in the addition of 10,000 undiscovered sites to the database.

When the database was originally developed, Casana had created morphological categories based on the different features evident in the imagery, which allows researchers to run queries. One of the categories was Poidebard's forts -- distinctive squares measuring approximately 50 by 100 meters (.03 x .06 miles), comparable in size to about half a soccer field.
The forts would have been large enough to accommodate soldiers, horses, and/or camels. Based on the satellite imagery, some of the forts had lookout towers in the corners or sides. They would have been made of stone and mud-brick or entirely of the latter, so eventually, these non-permanent structures would have melted into the ground.
While most of the forts that Poidebard documented were probably destroyed or obscured by agriculture, land use, or other activities between the 1920s and 1960s, the team was able to find 38 of 116 of Poidebard's forts, in addition to identifying 396 others.
Of those 396 forts, 290 were located in the study region and 106 were found in western Syria, in Jazireh. In addition to identifying forts similar to the walled fortresses Poidebard found, the team identified forts with interior architecture features and ones built around a mounded citadel.
""Our observations are pretty exciting and are just a fraction of what probably existed in the past,"" says Casana. ""But our analysis further supports that forts were likely used to support the movement of troops, supplies, and trade goods across the region.""

Utilising declassified images from the CORONA and HEXAGON spy satellite programmes, the authors report on the identification of a further 396 forts widely distributed across the northern Fertile Crescent. The addition of these forts questions Poidebard's defensive frontier thesis and suggests instead that the structures played a role in facilitating the movement of people and goods across the Syrian steppe."

Examining how plates move in Earth's mantle and how mountains form is no easy feat. Certain rocks that have sunk deep into Earth's interior and then returned from there can deliver answers.

Geoscientists analyze rocks in mountain belts to reconstruct how they once moved downwards into the depths and then returned to the surface. This history of burial and exhumation sheds light on the mechanisms of plate tectonics and mountain building. Certain rocks that sink far down into Earth's interior together with plates are transformed into different types under the enormous pressure that prevails there. During this UHP metamorphosis (UHP: Ultra High Pressure), silica (SiO2) in the rock, for example, becomes coesite, which is also referred to as the UHP polymorph of SiO2. Although it is chemically still silica, the crystal lattices are more tightly packed and therefore denser. When the plates move upwards again from the depths, the UHP rocks also come to the surface and can be found in certain places in the mountains. Their mineral composition provides information about the pressures to which they were exposed during their vertical journey through Earth's interior. Using lithostatic pressure as a unit of measurement, it is possible to correlate pressure and depth: the higher the pressure, the deeper the rocks once lay.
Until now, research had assumed that UHP rocks were buried at a depth of 120 kilometers. From there, they returned to the surface together with the plates. In the process, ambient pressure decreased at a stable rate, i.e. statically. However, a new study by Goethe University Frankfurt and the universities of Heidelberg and Rennes (France) calls this assumption of a long, continuous ascent into question. Among those involved in the study on the part of Goethe University Frankfurt were first author Cindy Luisier, who came to the university on a Humboldt Research Fellowship, and Thibault Duretz, head of the Geodynamic Modeling Working Group at the Department of Geosciences. The research team analyzed whiteschist from the Dora Maira Massif in the Western Alps, Italy. ""Whiteschists are rocks that formed as a result of the UHP metamorphosis of a hydrothermally altered granite during the formation of the Alps,"" explains Duretz. ""What is special about them is the large amount of coesite. The coesite crystals in the whiteschist are several hundred micrometers in size, which makes them ideal for our experiments."" The piece of whiteschist from the Dora Maira Massif contained pink garnets in a silvery-white matrix composed of quartz and other minerals. ""The rock has special chemical and thus mineralogical properties,"" says Duretz. Together with the team, he analyzed it by first cutting a very thin slice about 50 micrometers thick and then gluing it onto glass. In this way, it was possible to identify the minerals under a microscope. The next step was computer modeling of specific, particularly interesting areas.
These areas were silica particles surrounded by the grains of pink garnet, in which two SiO2 polymorphs had formed. One of these was coesite, which had formed under very high pressure (4.3 gigapascals). The other silica polymorph was quartz, which lay like a ring around the coesite. It had formed under much lower pressure (1.1 gigapascals). The whiteschist had evidently first been exposed to very high and then much lower pressure. There had been a sharp decrease in pressure or decompression. The most important discovery was that spoke-shaped cracks radiated from the SiO2 inclusions in all directions: the result of the phase transition from coesite to quartz. The effect of this transition was a large change in volume, and it caused extensive geological stresses in the rock. These made the garnet surrounding the SiO2 inclusions fracture. ""Such radial cracks can only form if the host mineral, the garnet, stays very strong,"" explains Duretz. ""At such temperatures, garnet only stays very strong if the pressure drops very quickly."" On a geological timescale, ""very quickly"" means in thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. In this ""short"" period, the pressure must have dropped from 4.3 to 1.1 gigapascals. The garnet would otherwise have creeped viscously to compensate for the change in volume in the SiO2 inclusions, instead of forming cracks.
According to Duretz, the previous assumption that UHP rock reaches a depth of 120 kilometers seems less probable in view of this rapid decompression because the ascent from such a depth would take place over a long period of time, which does not equate with the high decompression rate, he says. ""We rather presume that our whiteschist lay at a depth of only 60 to 80 kilometers,"" says the geoscientist. And the processes underway in Earth's interior could also be quite different than assumed in the past. That rock units move continuously upwards over great distances, from a depth of 120 kilometers to the surface, also seems less probable than previously thought. ""Our hypothesis is that rapid tectonic processes took place instead, which led to minimal vertical plate displacements."" We can imagine it like this, he says: The plates suddenly jerked upwards a little bit in Earth's interior -- and as a result the pressure surrounding the UHP rock decreased in a relatively short time.

How plate tectonics has evolved through time is still one of the fundamental questions in Earth sciences. Natural microstructures observed in exhumed ultrahigh-pressure rocks formed during continental collision provide crucial insights into tectonic processes in the Earth’s interior. Here, we show that radial cracks around SiO2 inclusions in ultrahigh-pressure garnets are caused by ultrafast decompression. Decompression rates of at least 8 GPa/Myr are inferred independently of current petrochronological estimates by using thermo-mechanical numerical modeling. Our results question the traditional interpretation of fast and significant vertical displacement of ultrahigh-pressure tectonic units during exhumation. Instead, we propose that such substantial decompression rates are related to abrupt changes in the stress state of the lithosphere independently of the spatial displacement."

Cyanobacteria are a key species in Earth's history, as they introduced atmospheric oxygen for the first time. The analysis of their evolution therefore provides important insights into the formation of modern aerobic ecosystems. For a long time, a certain type of fossil lipid, so-called 2-methylhopanes, was considered to be an important biomarker for Cyanobacteria in sediments, some of which are hundreds of millions of years old. However, this came into doubt when it turned out that not only Cyanobacteria but also Alphaproteobacteria are genetically capable of producing these lipids.

An international research team led by Yosuke Hoshino from the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences and Benjamin Nettersheim from MARUM -- Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen has now studied the phylogenetic diversification and distribution of the genes -- including HpnP -- that are responsible for the synthesis of the parent lipids for 2-methylhopanes: The researchers have deciphered when these genes were acquired by certain groups of organisms. They were able to show that HpnP was probably already present in the last common ancestor of Cyanobacteria more than two billion years ago, while the gene only appeared in Alphaproteobacteria about 750 million years ago. For the times before that, 2-methylhopanes can therefore serve as a clear biomarker for oxygen-producing Cyanobacteria.
The study, which has now been published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, shows how genetics, in interaction with sedimentology, paleobiology and geochemistry, can improve the diagnostic value of biomarkers and refine the reconstruction of early ecosystems.
Background: The importance of cyanobacteria in Earth's history
Cyanobacteria played a crucial role in transforming the Earth from its initial oxygen-free state to a modern, oxygen-rich system in which increasingly complex life is possible. Cyanobacteria were probably the only relevant group of organisms that converted inorganic substances into organic ones (so-called primary producers) and produced oxygen for long stretches of the Precambrian (the first four billion or so years of Earth's history, from its beginnings to about 540 million years ago). Therefore, the analysis of their evolution is of great importance for understanding the common history of life and Earth.
The importance of fossil lipids as biomarkers
In principle, the fossil remains of whole Cyanobacteria can serve as an indicator of the presence of oxygenic photosynthesis in the geological past. However, due to preservational biases and ambiguities in recognizing fossil cyanobacterial cells, geochemists rather use fossilised diagnostic lipids, such as 2-methylhopanes. 2-Methylhopanoids (non-fossilised parent molecules) are produced by the bacteria and -- in contrast to the bacteria themselves- can be fossilised and detected in sedimentary rocks even after hundreds of millions of years in good quality and in quantities corresponding to their original occurrence.

However, there have recently been doubts about the suitability of 2-methylhopane as a biomarker for Cyanobacteria: the discovery of the lipid biosynthesis gene revealed that Alphaproteobacteria are also capable of producing these lipids. This means that temporally tracing oxygen-producing processes on Earth by 2-methylhopanes is no longer possible.
New approach: Comprehensive genetic analysis combined with new, high-purity sediment analyses
An international research team led by Yosuke Hoshino and Christian Hallmann, scientists in GFZ Section 3.2 ""Organic Geochemistry,"" and Benjamin Nettersheim from MARUM at the University of Bremen has now systematically investigated which organisms other than Cyanobacteria possess the genes (abbreviated as the SC and HpnP genes) necessary for the production of 2-methylhopanoids, and when they acquired those genes during the course of evolution. In this way, the team was able to show that the fossil lipid 2-methylhopane can still be used as a clear biomarker for the existence of Cyanobacteria for times dating back more than 750 million years.
In addition, the researchers have created an integrated record of 2-methylhopane production over the course of Earth's history. For this, they combined their molecular data with new sediment analyses carried out under high-purity conditions.
""The method we proposed is in principle applicable to any organic matter in geological archives and has great potential to trace the evolution of different ecosystems with much higher temporal and spatial resolution than before,"" Hoshino sums up.
Methodology I: Computational study for genetic analysis
For the analysis of the genetic relationships, Hoshino searched publicly available databases, containing millions of gene and protein sequences, for organisms with the SC and HpnP genes. Based on this genetic data set, he created so-called phylogenetic trees, which provide information on how the SC and HpnP genes were transferred between different organisms and whether the gene transfer took place vertically via inheritance or horizontally between evolutionarily unrelated organisms. Furthermore, the researchers were also able to determine when individual gene transfers took place in the evolutionary history of the genes by comparing previous studies that utilized the so-called molecular clock technique that takes into account the DNA mutation rate and estimates the timeline for the gene evolution.

Methodology II: New type of ultra-clean sample preparation 
In addition, because Precambrian biomarker records are extremely sensitive to contamination, the researchers used an ultra-clean method to extract organic matter from sediment cores. The geological samples in the form of cores were collected by several co-authors from 16 countries. They represent different geological periods from the Paleoproterozoic (2.5 billion years ago) to the present. The relative abundance of 2-methylhopanes was then measured in the organic matter.
The results in detail 
There are many bacteria that possess both SC and HpnP genes, but they are mainly Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. Each group is found to have acquired the two genes independently. This is in contrast to earlier studies that concluded that Cyanobacteria acquired these genes from Alphaproteobacteria at a late stage in their evolution. The new study further revealed that the common ancestor of Cyanobacteria already possessed both genes more than 2.4 billion years ago, when oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere during the so-called Great Oxidation Event.
In contrast, Alphaproteobacteria acquired the SC and HpnP genes at the earliest only 750 million years ago. Before that, 2-methylhopanoids were thus only produced by Cyanobacteria. The researchers interpret a slightly delayed increase of sedimentary 2-methylhopanes around 600 million years ago as a sign of the global spread of Alphaproteobacteria, which may have favored the concurrent evolutionary rise of eukaryotic algae.
Summary and outlook
""The individual analytical methods mentioned above are not new, but few researchers have attempted to perform comprehensive analyses for SC and HpnP and to integrate genetic data with sedimentary biomarker data before, as this requires combining two completely different scientific disciplines -- molecular biology and organic geochemistry,"" says Hoshino.
""The source of sedimentary 2-methylhopanes has been a topic of long debate,"" adds Christian Hallmann. -- ""This new study not only provides clarity about the diagnosticity of 2-methylhopanes and the role of Cyanobacteria in deep time; its methodology offers a new avenue forward to refine the diagnosticity of, in theory, any biomarker lipid once the biosynthesis genes are known.""

However, the discovery of hopanoid C-2 methyltransferase (HpnP) in Alphaproteobacteria led to the downfall of this molecular proxy. In the present study, we re-examined the distribution of HpnP in a new phylogenetic framework including recently proposed candidate phyla and re-interpreted a revised geological record of 2-methylhopanes based on contamination-free samples. We show that HpnP was probably present in the last common ancestor of cyanobacteria, while the gene appeared in Alphaproteobacteria only around 750 million years ago (Ma). A subsequent rise of sedimentary 2-methylhopanes around 600 Ma probably reflects the expansion of Alphaproteobacteria that coincided with the rise of eukaryotic algae—possibly connected by algal dependency on microbially produced vitamin B12. Our findings re-establish 2-methylhopanes as cyanobacterial biomarkers before 750 Ma and thus as a potential tool to measure the importance of oxygenic cyanobacteria as primary producers on early Earth. Our study illustrates how genetics can improve the diagnostic value of biomarkers and refine the reconstruction of early ecosystems."

They don't know it, but Darwin's finches changed the world. These closely related species -- native to the Galapagos Islands -- each sport a uniquely shaped beak that matches their preferred diet. Studying these birds helped Charles Darwin develop the theory of evolution by natural selection.

A group of bats has a similar -- and more expansive -- evolutionary story to tell. There are more than 200 species of noctilionoid bats, mostly in the American tropics. And despite being close relatives, their jaws evolved in wildly divergent shapes and sizes to exploit different food sources. A paper published Aug. 22 in Nature Communications shows those adaptations include dramatic, but also consistent, modifications to tooth number, size, shape and position. For example, bats with short snouts lack certain teeth, presumably due to a lack of space. Species with longer jaws have room for more teeth -- and, like humans, their total tooth complement is closer to what the ancestor of placental mammals had.
According to the research team behind this study, comparing noctilionoid species can reveal a lot about how mammalian faces evolved and developed, particularly jaws and teeth. And as a bonus, they can also answer some outstanding questions about how our own pearly whites form and grow.
""Bats have all four types of teeth -- incisors, canines, premolars and molars -- just like we do,"" said co-author Sharlene Santana, a University of Washington professor of biology and curator of mammals at the Burke Museum of Natural History & Culture. ""And noctilionoid bats evolved a huge diversity of diets in as little as 25 million years, which is a very short amount of time for these adaptations to occur.""
""There are noctilionoid species that have short faces like bulldogs with powerful jaws that can bite the tough exterior of the fruits that they eat. Other species have long snouts to help them drink nectar from flowers. How did this diversity evolve so quickly? What had to change in their jaws and teeth to make this possible?"" said lead author Alexa Sadier, an incoming faculty member at the Institute of Evolutionary Science of Montpellier in France, who began this project as a postdoctoral researcher at the University California, Los Angeles.
Scientists don't know what triggered this frenzy of dietary adaptation in noctilionoid bats. But today different noctilionoid species feast on insects, fruit, nectar, fish and even blood -- since this group also includes the infamous vampire bats.
The team used CT scans and other methods to analyze the shapes and sizes of jaws, premolars and molars in more than 100 noctilionoid species. The bats included both museum specimens and a limited number of wild bats captured for study purposes. The researchers compared the relative sizes of teeth and other cranial features among species with different types of diets, and used mathematical modeling to determine how those differences are generated during development.

The team found that, in noctilionoid bats, certain ""developmental rules"" caused them to generate the right assortment of teeth to fit in their diet-formed grins. For example, bats with long jaws -- like nectar-feeders -- or intermediate jaws, like many insect-eaters, tended to have the usual complement of three premolars and three molars on each side of the jaw. But bats with short jaws, including most fruit-eating bats, tended to ditch the middle premolar or the back molar, if not both.
""When you have more space, you can have more teeth,"" said Sadier. ""But for bats with a shorter space, even though they have a more powerful bite, you simply run out of room for all these teeth.""
Having a shorter jaw may also explain why many short-faced bats also tended to have wider front molars.
""The first teeth to appear tend to grow bigger since there is not enough space for the next ones to emerge,"" said Sadier.
""This project is giving us the opportunity to actually test some of the assumptions that have been made about how tooth growth, shape and size are regulated in mammals,"" said Santana. ""We know surprisingly little about how these very important structures develop!""
Many studies about mammalian tooth development were done in mice, which have only molars and heavily modified incisors. Scientists are not entirely sure if the genes and developmental patterns that control tooth development in mice also operate in mammals with more ""ancestral"" sets of chompers -- like bats and humans.
Sadier, Santana and their colleagues believe their project, which is ongoing, can start to answer these questions in bats -- along with many other outstanding questions about how evolution shapes mammalian features. They're expanding this study to include noctilionoid incisors and canines, and hope to uncover more of the genetic and developmental mechanisms that control tooth development in this diverse group of bats.
""We see such strong selective pressures in these bats: Shapes have to closely match their function,"" said Santana. ""I think there are many more evolutionary secrets hidden in these species.""

However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which tooth classes diversified remain limited. We use the evolutionary radiation of noctilionoid bats to show how the tooth developmental program evolved during the adaptation to new diet types. Combining morphological, developmental and mathematical modeling approaches, we demonstrate that tooth classes develop through independent developmental cascades that deviate from classical models. We show that the diversification of tooth number and size is driven by jaw growth rate modulation, explaining the rapid gain/loss of teeth in this clade. Finally, we mathematically model the successive appearance of tooth buds, supporting the hypothesis that growth acts as a key driver of the evolution of tooth number and size. Our work reveal how growth, by tinkering with reaction/diffusion processes, drives the diversification of tooth classes and other repeated structure during adaptive radiations."

The explosion of the underwater volcano Kolumbo in the Aegean Sea in 1650 triggered a destructive tsunami that was described by historical eye witnesses. A group of researchers led by Dr Jens Karstens from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel has now surveyed Kolumbo's underwater crater with modern imaging technology and reconstructed the historical events. They found that the eyewitness accounts of the natural disaster can only be described by a combination of a landslide followed by an explosive eruption. Their findings are published today in the journal Nature Communications.

From the Greek island of Santorini, the eruption had been visible for several weeks. In the late summer of 1650, people reported that the colour of the water had changed and the water was boiling. About seven kilometres north-east of Santorini, an underwater volcano had risen from the sea and began ejecting glowing rocks. Fire and lightning could be seen, and plumes of smoke darkened the sky. Then the water suddenly receded, only to surge towards the coastline moments later, battering it with waves up to 20 metres high. A huge bang was heard more than 100 kilometres away, pumice and ash fell on the surrounding islands, and a deadly cloud of poisonous gas claimed several lives.
""We know these details of the historic eruption of Kolumbo because there are contemporary reports that were compiled and published by a French volcanologist in the 19th century,"" says Dr Jens Karstens, marine geophysicist at GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. But how did these devastating events come about? To find out, he and his German and Greek colleagues went to the Greek Aegean Sea in 2019 to study the volcanic crater with special technology. Karstens: ""We wanted to understand how the tsunami came about at that time and why the volcano exploded so violently.""
On board the now decommissioned research vessel POSEIDON, the team used 3D seismic methods to create a three-dimensional image of the crater, which is now 18 metres below the water's surface. Dr Gareth Crutchley, co-author of the study: ""This allows us to look inside the volcano."" Not only did the 3D imaging show that the crater was 2.5 kilometres in diameter and 500 metres deep, suggesting a truly massive explosion, the seismic profiles also revealed that one flank of the cone had been severely deformed. Crutchley: ""This part of the volcano has certainly slipped."" The researchers then took a detective's approach, comparing the various mechanisms that could have caused the tsunami with the historical eyewitness accounts. They concluded that only a combination of a landslide followed by a volcanic explosion could explain the tsunami. Their findings are published today in the journal Nature Communications.
By combining 3D seismics with computer simulations, the researchers were able to reconstruct how high the waves would have been if they had been generated by the explosion alone. Karstens: ""According to this, waves of six metres would have been expected at one particular location, but we know from the reports of eyewitnesses that they were 20 metres high there."" Furthermore, the sea is said to have first receded at another point, but in the computer simulation a wave crest reaches the coast first. Thus, the explosion alone cannot explain the tsunami event. However, when the landslide was included in the simulations, the data agreed with historical observations.
Jens Karstens explains: ""Kolumbo consists partly of pumice with very steep slopes. It is not very stable. During the eruption, which had been going on for several weeks, lava was continuously ejected. Underneath, in the magma chamber, which contained a lot of gas, there was enormous pressure. When one of the volcano's flanks slipped, the effect was like uncorking a bottle of champagne: the sudden release of pressure allowed the gas in the magma system to expand, resulting in a huge explosion."" Something similar could have happened during the 2022 eruption of the Hunga Tonga undersea volcano, whose volcanic crater has a similar shape to Kolumbo's.
The study thus provides valuable information for the development of monitoring programmes for active submarine volcanic activity, such as SANTORY, which is led by co-author Prof. Dr Paraskevi Nomikou of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA). ""We hope to be able to use our results to develop new approaches to monitor volcanic unrest,"" says Jens Karstens, ""maybe even an early warning system, collecting data in real time. That would be my dream.""
About 3D Marine Reflection Seismics
3D seismics is a geophysical technique that exploits the fact that sound waves are partially reflected at the boundaries of layers. This makes it possible to create cross-sectional profiles of geological structures beneath the seabed. Unlike 2D reflection seismics, marine 3D reflection seismics uses multiple measuring cables (housing receivers) towed in parallel behind the research vessel. The result is a three-dimensional image, known as a seismic volume, which allows us to look beneath the seafloor and analyse the geology in detail.

Tsunami generation during volcanic eruptions is complex and often due to a combination of processes. The 1650 eruption of the Kolumbo submarine volcano triggered a tsunami causing major destruction on surrounding islands in the Aegean Sea. However, the source mechanisms behind the tsunami have been disputed due to difficulties in sampling and imaging submarine volcanoes. Here we show, based on three-dimensional seismic data, that ~1.2 km³ of Kolumbo’s northwestern flank moved 500–1000 m downslope along a basal detachment surface. This movement is consistent with depressurization of the magma feeding system, causing a catastrophic explosion. Numerical tsunami simulations indicate that only the combination of flank movement followed by an explosive eruption can explain historical eyewitness accounts. This cascading sequence of natural hazards suggests that assessing submarine flank movements is critical for early warning of volcanogenic tsunamis."

Endangered whales and dolphins live year-round in an area of the Mediterranean earmarked for oil and gas exploration, new research shows.

Various cetacean species are known to inhabit the Hellenic Trench off Greece in the summer, but until now little has been known about their winter whereabouts.
This lack of information has been used to justify seismic surveys (which may harm whales and dolphins) in winter.
The new study found that at least four species -- including the regionally endangered sperm whale -- live in the deep waters of the Hellenic Trench in both summer and winter.
The research was carried out in 2021-22 by the Greenpeace Research Laboratories, University of Exeter, Greenpeace Greece and the Pelagos Cetacean Research Institute.
""The Mediterranean is one of the busiest seas on the planet, and whales and dolphins are already threatened by ship strikes, overfishing, bycatch (accidental catching), pollution with chemicals and plastics, and climate change,"" said Dr Kirsten Thompson.
""Noise is also a key threat. Certain whale species, for example the Cuvier's beaked whales, are known to be particularly vulnerable to human-made noise, which comes from sources including ship engines, military sonar and 'air guns' used to survey for oil and gas.

""These combined threats could affect populations of whales and dolphins that rely on the Hellenic Trench as key habitat.
""The shallower waters of the Hellenic Trench have been designated as an Important Marine Mammal Area. Based on our findings, it is clear that seismic surveys and oil and gas extraction across the Trench would be completely at odds with conservation.""
Co-author Dr Alexandros Frantzis, Scientific Director of Pelagos Cetacean Research Institute, said: ""We have already shown that ship-strikes alone will drive the eastern Mediterranean population of sperm whales to extinction in a few decades, if no measures (shipping lanes and/or creation of Areas to be Avoided) are taken along the Hellenic Trench.
""For nine years, we have been trying to convince the Greek authorities to address this problem in collaboration with the International Maritime Organisation, with no concrete results.
""On the other hand, the local population of Cuvier's beaked whales, after decades of repeated mass strandings due to military sonar use, are declining as well as the striped dolphins that inhabit the Hellenic Trench.
""Seismic surveys and gas and oil exploration in the area will be the 'coup de grace' for the local cetacean populations if added to the already existing anthropogenic pressures and threats.""
Kostis Grimanis, of Greenpeace Greece, added: ""This important research demonstrates clearly that endangered whales and dolphins live year-round in an area of the Mediterranean of huge ecological importance.

""The choice to follow through with oil and gas drilling in those waters will not only be detrimental to our collective fight against the climate crisis but also to our collective efforts to conserve and protect those iconic species of marine biodiversity.""
The researchers used two Greenpeace vessels to carry out visual and acoustic surveys of large areas of the Hellenic Trench, including two blocks that are earmarked for seismic surveys and potential oil and gas exploration (west Crete and south-west Crete).
The area may also be affected by a proposed new gas pipeline called EastMed, which would connect eastern Mediterranean gas reserves to Greece.
Using sightings and computer analysis of audio recordings, the research team confirmed the presence of endangered sperm whales, Cuvier's beaked whales (classified as ""vulnerable"" in the Mediterranean), Risso's dolphins, striped dolphins and rough-toothed dolphins.
They confirmed a further 224 recordings of unidentified dolphins (several dolphins have similar vocalisations, so it is not always possible to distinguish between them).

Ancient people immigrated to Cancun Island and were treated just like locals, according to a study published October 25, 2023 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Andrea Cucina of the Autonomous University of Yucatan, Mexico and colleagues.

The Late Postclassic (AD 1200-1500) in the northern Maya lowlands was a period of major changes, including the development of many settlements along the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, influenced in part by expanded trade routes. Previous research has found that these settlements were home to many non-local individuals, but it remains unclear whether these people were treated as ""foreigners"" or if they were integrated into local society.
In this study, Cucina and colleagues analyzed the remains of 50 individuals from two archaeological sites on Cancun Island dating to the Late Postclassic. Investigating strontium isotope signatures in teeth, the team determined that seven of these individuals appear to have been born elsewhere in the Maya lowlands, not local to these sites. However, examination of carbon isotopes (as a proxy for diet) and the construction of the graves of these individuals found no significant difference between locals and non-locals, suggesting that they were all treated similarly in terms of the food they ate and how they were buried.
These results suggest that these non-local individuals had integrated into local culture despite being from other regions. The fact that the non-local people included adults and children suggests that whole families, not just individuals, were in the habit of moving residence. One notable limitation of this study is that these techniques cannot detect ""second generation immigrants,"" a potentially valuable source of information that will have to be investigated using different methods. Analyzing patterns of mobility in Prehispanic Mesoamerica is essential for a thorough understanding of cultural networks of the time.
The authors add: ""In the Postclassic period (AD 1200-1520) the east coast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula saw the arrival of foreign people, who were assumed, based on archaeological and architectural records, to come from several locations in central Mexico. However, the current research shows migration from within the Maya cultural region (from what is now Belize, Peten, Guatemala and other parts of the Yucatan Peninsula). Migration for economic, environmental, political or kinship considerations is a familiar part of the human experience, and the current study documents the past movement and integration of individuals, and possibly entire families, into new communities. People may have relocated for similar reasons as they do today -- for economic, environmental, political or kinship considerations.""

Human populations in Neolithic Europe fluctuated with changing climates, according to a study published October 25, 2023 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Ralph Großmann of Kiel University, Germany and colleagues.

The archaeological record is a valuable resource for exploring the relationship between humans and the environment, particularly how each is affected by the other. In this study, researchers examined Central European regions rich in archaeological remains and geologic sources of climate data, using these resources to identify correlations between human population trends and climate change.
The three regions examined are the Circumharz region of central Germany, the Czech Republic/Lower Austria region, and the Northern Alpine Foreland of southern Germany. Researchers compiled over 3400 published radiocarbon dates from archaeological sites in these regions to serve as indicators of ancient populations, following the logic that more dates are available from larger populations leaving behind more materials. Climate data came from cave formations in these regions which provide datable information about ancient climate conditions. These data span 3550-1550 BC, from the Late Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age.
The study found a notable correlation between climate and human populations. During warm and wet times, populations tended to increase, likely bolstered by improved crops and economies. During cold and dry times, populations often decreased, sometimes experiencing major cultural shifts with potential evidence of increasing social inequality, such as the emergence of high status ""princely burials"" of some individuals in the Circumharz region.
These results suggest that at least some of the trends in human populations over time can be attributed to the effects of changing climates. The authors acknowledge that these data are susceptible to skewing by limitations of the archaeological record in these regions, and that more data will be important to support these results. This type of study is crucial for understanding human connectivity to the environment and the impacts of changing climates on human cultures.
The authors add: ""Between 5500 and 3500 years ago, climate was a major factor in population development in the regions around the Harz Mountains, in the northern Alpine foreland and in the region of what is now the Czech Republic and Austria. However, not only the population size, but also the social structures changed with climate fluctuations.""

In this paper, we reconstruct the rate and density of the available 14C data from 5500 to 3500 calBP (3550–1550 BCE). We ask to what extent population patterns varied over time and space, and whether fluctuations in human populations and their activities varied with local/regional climate changes. To answer these questions, we have compiled an extensive list of published radiocarbon dates and created 14C sum calibrations for each region. We also compare population dynamics with local and regional palaeoclimate records derived from high-resolution speleothems. At the regional scale, the results suggest a causal relationship between regional climate and population trends. Climate and associated environmental changes were thus at least partly responsible for demographic trends. These results also allow us to question the motivation for the construction of so-called “Early Bronze Age princely tombs” in the Circumharz region during a period of population decline. Among other things, it can be argued that the upper echelons of society may have benefited from trade relations. However, this process was accompanied by ecological stress, a cooling of the winter climate, a decline in the total population and an increase in social inequality."

Scientists have long debated the Anthropocene Epoch, a proposed unit of geologic time corresponding to the most recent period in history. It's characterized by substantial human impact on the planet.

Are we living in the Anthropocene? And if we are, then when did it start?
In a research article published this month in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, The University of Toledo's Dr. Trisha Spanbauer and Stanford University's Dr. M. Allison Stegner lend credence to the argument for its existence. The pair analyzed open-source data to track vegetation changes across North America since the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, and conclude that humans have had as much of an impact on the landscape as the retreat of the glaciers at the end of the Ice Age.
""As a paleolimnologist I'm very interested in what the past can tell us about the future,"" said Spanbauer, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences. ""Biotic changes have been used to demarcate epochs in the past, so this analysis gives us valuable context to understand if what we're seeing today is fundamentally similar in magnitude to what we would have seen at the shift between the Pleistocene Epoch and the Holocene Epoch.""
Spanbauer and Stegner utilized the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, a community-curated repository for multiple kinds of paleoecological data. They specifically looked at fossil pollen data sourced from 386 sediment cores records taken from lakes across North America.
Sediment cores are samples taken from the bottom of a lake that preserve the depositional sequence. Spanbauer and Stegner considered samples taken as early as the late Pleistocene -- around 14,000 years ago.
They analyzed the data according to seven metrics: taxonomic richness, meaning the diversity of pollen species; first appearance datum, last appearance datum, and short-term gain and loss of taxa, measuring the frequency with which species appear and disappear in fossil records; and abrupt community changes, referring to species identified in the samples. They organized their data points within 250-year time periods and on both continental and regional scales, and incorporated age-model uncertainty and accounted for differences in sample size to generate conservative estimates.
Their results indicate that vegetation changes within the last few hundred years are comparable to those accompanying the last epochal transition, including increases in first and last appearances as well as abrupt community changes.
""The power of a database like this is that we're able to ask questions about macroscale ecological changes,"" Spanbauer said. ""Scientists have documented the effects of human activity on single species and on biodiversity in general, but our research puts these observations into a much broader context. It indicates a change in how ecosystems are functioning that supports the delineation of a new epoch.""

Using a rich dataset of late Quaternary pollen records, stored in the open-access and community-curated Neotoma database, we analyzed changes in biodiversity and community composition since the end Pleistocene in North America. We measured taxonomic richness, short-term taxonomic loss and gain, first/last appearances (FAD/LAD), and abrupt community change. For all analyses, we incorporated age-model uncertainty and accounted for differences in sample size to generate conservative estimates. The most prominent signals of elevated vegetation change were seen during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and since 200 calendar years before present (cal YBP). During the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, abrupt changes and FADs were elevated, and from 200 to −50 cal YBP, we found increases in short-term taxonomic loss, FADs, LADs, and abrupt changes. Taxonomic richness declined from ~13,000 cal YBP until about 6,000 cal YBP and then increased until the present, reaching levels seen during the end Pleistocene. Regionally, patterns were highly variable. These results show that recent changes associated with anthropogenic impacts are comparable to the landscape changes that took place as we moved from a glacial to interglacial world."

A scientist from the University of Leicester has discovered a new type of fossil that reveals life in the oceans half a billion years ago.

The tiny organisms, detailed in a new study in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, resemble modern-day algae and might also give scientists an insight into the climate changes that affected our oceans.
The fossils are microscopic and look like spiny balls connected together. The study's author Dr Tom Harvey, from the University of Leicester School of Geography, Geology and the Environment, said: ""When I first saw them, I had no idea what they were. I wondered if they could be animal eggs, or some new type of organism. There's nothing quite like them, living or extinct.""
But as further specimens came to light, Dr Harvey identified similarities with modern green algae that live floating in the plankton of ponds and lakes. He explains: ""The fossils have the same sort of colonial structure as the modern algae, with cells linking together, explaining their neat, geometric arrangements. Surprisingly, though, the fossil examples lived in the sea, giving a rare glimpse of the early marine plankton.""
The importance of the fossils lies in their immense age. They lived around the time when animals were first evolving, during the Cambrian 'explosion' of life -- and this is probably no coincidence. In today's world, phytoplankton provides the fundamental food source for almost all life in the oceans. However, the modern groups of phytoplankton evolved relatively recently, and we do not know which groups inhabited the Cambrian oceans.
Dr Harvey explains: ""When we look at modern plankton, we see that algae develop colonies when animals are trying to eat them. It's a defence mechanism. So, the existence of colonial algae in the Cambrian Period suggests that early animals were evolving to feed in the plankton, starting a predator-prey relationship that has continued ever since.
""Considering that the plankton underpins life in the oceans, and fossil plankton helps us build ancient climate models, these small fossils have a big role in telling the history of life on Earth.""
The new discovery will prompt a re-think on other early microfossils. For years, scientists have thought that the spiny balls found individually were the dormant cysts of single-celled life.
For Dr Harvey, the new fossils seriously challenge this view: ""I wonder if we've been getting it all wrong, and in fact lots of these microfossils were living as colonies in the plankton. It's easy to accidentally break up the fossils as we extract them from the rocks, so we all need to get back to the collections, back to our labs, and find out how common they really were.""

However, the diversity, affinities and ecologies of Cambrian phytoplankton are poorly understood, leaving unclear the role of animal interactions and the drivers of diversification. New exceptionally preserved acritarchs (problematic organic-walled microfossils) from the late early Cambrian (around 510 Ma) reveal colonial organization characterized by rings and plates of interconnected, geometrically arranged cells. The assemblage exhibits a wide but gradational variation in cell size, ornamentation and intercell connection, interpreted as representing one or more species with determinate (coenobial) colony formation via cell division, aggregation and growth by cell expansion. An equivalent strategy is known only among green algae, specifically chlorophycean chlorophytes. The fossils differ in detail from modern freshwater examples and apparently represent an earlier convergent radiation in marine settings. Known trade-offs between sinking risk and predator avoidance in colonial phytoplankton point to adaptations triggered by intensifying grazing pressure during a Cambrian metazoan invasion of the water column. The new fossils reveal that not all small acritarchs are unicellular resting cysts, and support an early Palaeozoic prominence of green algal phytoplankton as predicted by molecular biomarkers."

Since the HMS Beagle arrived in the Galapagos with Charles Darwin to meet a fateful family of finches, ecologists have struggled to understand a particularly perplexing question: Why is there a ridiculous abundance of species some places on earth and a scarcity in others? What factors, exactly, drive animal diversity?

With access to a mammoth set of global-scale climate data and a novel strategy, a team from the Department of Watershed Sciences in Quinney College of Natural Resources and the Ecology Center identified several factors to help answer this fundamental ecological question. They discovered that what an animal eats (and how that interacts with climate) shapes Earth's diversity.
The work was recently published in the high-impact journal Ecology Letters.
""Historically studies looking at the distribution of species across Earth's latitudinal gradient have overlooked the role of trophic ecology -- how what animals eat impacts where they are found,"" said Trisha Atwood, author on the study from the Department of Watershed Sciences and the Ecology Center. ""This new work shows that predators, omnivores and herbivores are not randomly scattered across the globe. There are patterns to where we find these groups of animals.""
Certain locations have an unexpected abundance of meat-eating predators -- parts of Africa, Europe and Greenland. Herbivores are common in cooler areas, and omnivores tend to be more dominant in warm places. Two key factors emerged as crucial in shaping these patterns: precipitation and plant growth.
Precipitation patterns across time play a big role in determining where different groups of mammals thrive, Atwood said. Geographical areas where precipitation varies by season, without being too extreme, had the highest levels of mammal diversity.
""Keep in mind that we aren't talking about the total amount of rain,"" said Jaron Adkins, lead author on the research. ""If you imagine ecosystems around the world on a scale of precipitation and season, certain places in Utah and the Amazon rainforest fall on one end with low variability -- they have steady levels of precipitation throughout the year. Other regions, like southern California, have really high variability, getting about 75 percent of the annual precipitation between December and March.""
But the sweet spot for predators and herbivores fell in a middle zone between the two extremes, he said. Places like Madagascar, where precipitation patterns had an equal split between a wet season and a dry one (six months each), had the ideal ecological cocktail for promoting conditions for these two groups. Omnivore diversity tends to thrive in places with very stable climates.

The second important factor connected with mammal diversity the work uncovered was a measure of the amount of plant growth in an area, measured as ""gross primary productivity.""
""It makes intuitive sense for plant-eating animals to benefit from plant growth,"" Adkins said.
But this measure actually impacted carnivores most, according to the research. The strong relationship between predators and plant growth highlights the importance of an abundance of plants on an entire food chain's structural integrity.
""It was surprising that this factor was more important for predators than omnivores and herbivores,"" Atwood said. ""Why this is remains a mystery.""
Although evolutionary processes are ultimately responsible for spurring differences in species, climate conditions can impact related factors -- rates of evolutionary change, extinction and animal dispersal -- influencing species and trait-based richness, according to the research.
Animal diversity is rapidly declining in many ecosystems around the world through habitat loss and climate change. This has negative consequences for ecosystems. Forecasting how climate change will disrupt animal systems going forward is extremely important, Atwood said, and this research is a first step in better managing future conditions for animals around the world.
""Animal diversity can act as an alarm system for the stability of ecosystems,"" Atwood said. ""Identifying the ecological mechanisms that help drive richness patterns provides insight for better managing and predicting how diversity could change under future climates.""
In addition to Adkins and Atwood, the research included seven authors currently or previously associated with the Department of Watershed Sciences and the Ecology Center: Edd Hammill, Umarfarooq Abdulwahab, John Draper, Marshall Wolf, Catherine McClure, Adrián González Ortiz and Emily Chavez.

Different trophic groups (predators, omnivores and herbivores) interact with their environments in fundamentally different ways and may therefore be influenced by different environmental drivers. Using random forest models, we identified drivers of terrestrial mammals' total and proportional species richness within trophic groups at a global scale. Precipitation seasonality was the most important predictor of richness for all trophic groups. Richness peaked at intermediate precipitation seasonality, indicating that moderate levels of environmental heterogeneity promote mammal richness. Gross primary production (GPP) was the most important correlate of the relative contribution of each trophic group to total species richness. The strong relationship with GPP demonstrates that basal‐level resource availability influences how diversity is structured among trophic groups. Our findings suggest that environmental characteristics that influence resource temporal variability and abundance are important predictors of terrestrial mammal richness at a global scale."

Meltwater that runs along the east coast of Greenland, hardly enters the open ocean before reaching the western side of the island. That is one of the conclusions NIOZ PhD-candidate Elodie Duyck draws in the thesis she is defending today at Utrecht University. In the changing climate, fresh water from Greenland and the Arctic could disrupt the circulation in the Atlantic Ocean. ""Understanding where, and how much, of that fresh and light water enters the Atlantic Ocean is critical to predict how the circulation may evolve under climate change,"" Duyck says.

Greenland and the Atlantic Ocean circulation
In the coming decades, climate change will lead to increasing amounts of freshwater from Greenland and the Arctic entering the northern North Atlantic Ocean. These waters are less dense than the seawater around Greenland and may hinder the exchange between the surface and deep ocean that usually takes place in this region. This could lead to a weakening of the so-called Atlantic Meridional Overtuning Circulation (AMOC), the large-scale circulation of the Atlantic Ocean, that brings warm water northward at the surface and returns cold water southward at greater depths, affecting the climate in large parts of the world.
Freshwater pathways
Waters from Greenland and the Arctic initially flow close to the Greenland coast. The extent to which the fresh water then spreads into the open ocean remains uncertain. Direct measurements of the circulation, done by NIOZ and others in the scientific program 'Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program' (OSNAP), show that the Irminger Sea, south-east of Greenland, is particularly important for the Atlantic Ocean's circulation.
Drifting buoys
To investigate whether fresh waters enter the Irminger Sea, Duyck deployed a total of one hundred and twenty buoys along Greenland's east coast. Using sea anchors, she ensured that those buoys drifted with the surface currents, free from the disruptive influence of wind or waves. Those buoys were carried southward along the Greenland coast, until they reached the western side of Greenland.

Limited export east of Greenland
Duyck identified a few areas along the eastern coast of Greenland where fresh shelf water mixes with Atlantic waters, and one area, at the southernmost tip of Greenland, where freshwater may be exported in larger quantities during strong wind events. But overall, buoys tended to remain close to the coast until they reached the western side of Greenland: ""This means that meltwater hardly flows from the south-east coast of Greenland to the Irminger Sea,"" Duyck explains.
Further studies
About one third of the buoys that were released on the eastern side of Greenland were exported to the Labrador Sea, on the western side of Greenland, where more exchange between the coastal area and the open ocean is known to take place: ""This means that the circulation on the eastern side of Greenland may impact how much freshwater enters the Labrador Sea, on the western side of Greenland,"" Duyck says. The fresh doctor is already working on a new project, at the University of Hamburg, where she uses similar instrument to investigate how freshwater enters the Labrador Sea and how this may affect the ocean circulation in the future.

However, freshwater pathways from the Greenland shelf to interior seas and deep convection regions are not fully understood. We investigate exchanges of liquid freshwater between the east Greenland shelf and neighboring seas using drifter data from five deployments carried out at different latitudes along the east Greenland shelf in 2019, 2020, and 2021, as well as satellite data and an atmospheric reanalysis. We compute Ekman transport from winds and geostrophic velocity from satellite altimetry at the shelfbreak and identify the Blosseville Basin and Cape Farewell as areas favorable to cross‐shelf exchanges. We further investigate exchange processes in these regions using drifter data. In the Blosseville Basin, drifters are brought off‐shelf toward the Iceland Sea and into the interior of the Basin. As they are advected downstream, they re‐enter the shelf and are driven toward the coast. At Cape Farewell, the wind appears to be the main driver, although on one occasion we found evidence of an eddy turning drifters away from the shelf. The drifters brought off‐shelf at Cape Farewell mostly continue around Eirik Ridge, where they re‐enter the West Greenland Current. Overall, the identified export over the east Greenland shelf is limited, small scale, and intermittent, thus unlikely to flux large amount of liquid freshwater into the interior, though exchange processes could enhance mixing in the near‐shelf region."

In ancient Egypt, various deities were portrayed as animals. Thoth, the god of learning and wisdom was represented by a hamadryas baboon. Baboons, probably held in captivity in Egypt, were mummified as votive offerings after their deaths. Today, no wild baboons live in Egypt, and there is no evidence to suggest that these primates did so in the past. In an interdisciplinary project involving biologists, Egyptologists and anthropologists, Gisela Kopp, a biologist from Konstanz who conducts research on non-human primates, pursued the question of how and from where baboons came to Egypt. The results have been published in the current issue of the journal eLife.

Baboons were imported
To pay homage to the deity Thoth, baboons were probably imported from distant regions and kept in captivity in ancient Egypt. As studies of skeletons show, they had their dangerous canine teeth removed. To determine the geographic origin of the baboons, Gisela Kopp and her team used genetic analyses. The region from which the animals originate can be determined with the help of the mitochondrial genome of the animal mummies. The distribution of baboons across the African continent and their genetic diversity is well studied.
""We have comparative samples from almost all regions where baboons live today,"" Gisela Kopp says. These were supplemented with approximately 100 to 150-year-old specimens from museum collections. Comparisons of samples from the widely separated time periods are possible because the location of the different genetic variants of the baboon populations is very consistent over time.
Comparative sample points to Adulis
One of the study's collaborators, anthropologist Nathaniel Dominy from Dartmouth College in the United States, had already used stable isotopes to identify the respective geographic locations of mummified baboons. This method of using chemical signatures can be employed to distinguish between where animals were born and where they grew up. The study, published in 2020, was able to identify the Horn of Africa as the baboons' region of origin. Using genetic analysis, which has higher geographic precision and can also determine where the animals and their ancestors came from originally, the location was narrowed down to a well-defined area in Eritrea and neighbouring regions. A comparative sample that was most similar to the genetic variant of the mummy specimen originates from the coastal region in Eritrea, where, in ancient times, the port of Adulis was probably located. Ancient texts refer to Adulis as a trading place for luxury goods and animals.
The mummy specimen used by Gisela Kopp and her team was excavated in 1905 in the ""Valley of the Monkeys"" and is now held in the Musée des Confluences in Lyon. The mummy is estimated to date back to between 800 and 500 BCE in the Late Period of ancient Egypt. This is long before Adulis flourished as an important trading centre and port.

Early historical texts mention Punt as the baboons' place of origin, a legendary region from which Egypt imported luxury goods for centuries until early in the first millennium BCE. However, the exact location of Punt is unknown. ""Egyptologists have long puzzled over Punt, since some scholars have seen it as a location in early global maritime trade networks, and thus the starting point for economic globalization,"" says Gisela Kopp.
Egyptology provides the link between Punt and Adulis
Punt is documented in ancient illustrations and texts from the same period as the mummy specimens. The Egyptological expertise in the project made it possible to link Punt to Adulis. ""The specimen we studied fits chronologically with the last known expeditions to Punt. Geographically, however, it fits Adulis, a location that, centuries later, was known as a trading place, also for primates. We hypothesize that Punt and Adulis are two different names for the same place that were used at different points in time,"" Gisela Kopp says. And: ""It was only after we put our biological findings in the context of historical research that the story really came together.""
In the field of biology itself the findings are a scientific breakthrough, because it was the first time that ancient DNA from mummified non-human primates was analyzed successfully. This opens up opportunities to study, for example, the impact of human-wildlife interactions on genetic diversity and their role in the transmission of diseases. The contact ancient Egyptians had with exotic animals is evidence for early intensive interactions between wild animals and humans. The mass mummification of different animal species and primates is a very extraordinary cultural practice.
The representation of baboons in images and artwork since antiquity is only found in Egypt. We do not know what made these primates special to people at that time and why they were elevated to the role of representing the deity Thoth. People that share an environment with baboons usually do not hold the animals in high regard. For these people, baboons were and are considered a nuisance and pest for damaging crops.

Several classical geographers—Agatharchides of Cnidus, Pliny the Elder, Strabo—noted the value of Adulis to Greco-Roman Egypt, particularly as an emporium for living animals, including baboons (Papio spp.). Though fragmentary, these accounts predict the Adulite origins of mummified baboons in Ptolemaic catacombs, while inviting questions on the geoprovenance of older (Late Period) baboons recovered from Gabbanat el-Qurud (‘Valley of the Monkeys’), Egypt. Dated to ca. 800–540 BCE, these animals could extend the antiquity of Egyptian–Adulite trade by as much as five centuries. Previously, Dominy et al. (2020) used stable isotope analysis to show that two New Kingdom specimens of Papio hamadryas originate from the Horn of Africa. Here, we report the complete mitochondrial genomes from a mummified baboon from Gabbanat el-Qurud and 14 museum specimens with known provenance together with published georeferenced mitochondrial sequence data. Phylogenetic assignment connects the mummified baboon to modern populations of P. hamadryas in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and eastern Sudan. This result, assuming geographical stability of phylogenetic clades, corroborates Greco-Roman historiographies by pointing toward present-day Eritrea, and by extension Adulis, as a source of baboons for Late Period Egyptians. It also establishes geographic continuity with baboons from the fabled Land of Punt (Dominy et al., 2020), giving weight to speculation that Punt and Adulis were essentially the same trading centres separated by a thousand years of history."

Diamonds contain evidence of the mantle rocks that helped buoy and grow the ancient supercontinent Gondwana from below, according to new research from a team of scientists led by Suzette Timmerman -- formerly of the University of Alberta and now at the University of Bern -- and including Carnegie's Steven Shirey, Michael Walter, and Andrew Steele. Their findings, published in Nature, demonstrate that superdeep diamonds can provide a window through space and time into the supercontinent growth and formation process.

For billions of years, Earth's landmasses have been ripped apart and smashed back together by plate tectonics, periodically forming giant supercontinents. This formation process results from large-scale convection of the planet's mantle. But the records of these events are poorly preserved, because the oceanic crust is young and continually sinks beneath the planet's surface by a process called subduction, while the continental crust only provides a limited view of Earth's deep workings.
Surprisingly, the research team was able to show that superdeep diamonds that formed between 300 and 700 kilometers below Earth's surface can reveal how material was added to the base of a once-mighty supercontinent.
""These diamonds allow us to see how deep plate tectonic processes relate to the supercontinent cycle,"" Shirey said.
The supercontinent Gondwana is thought to have formed between 800 and 550 million years ago in Neoproterozoic times. Starting over the present-day location of the South Pole, it incorporated the landmasses that make up present day South America, Africa, the Middle East, India, and Australia.
""By revealing the geological processes that contributed to Gondwana's growth, scientists can better understand the forces that shaped Earth's history and phenomenon of continental stability, which is -- of course -- fundamental to the eventual success of life on our planet,"" added Walter.
About 40 to 250 kilometers beneath the surface, geologic formations called mantle keels act as the foundation of the continental crust. The material that forms these keels thickened, stabilized, and cooled under the continental blocks to form strong, buoyant structures that can resist the relentless destructive forces of Earth's tectonic activity.

Remnants of the mantle rocks that helped form the keel can be found in tiny silicate and sulfide inclusions hidden inside these superdeep diamonds. Typically flaws in normal gem diamonds, these inclusions are the best friends of a geoscientist. They were identified, isolated, studied crystallographically, and then radiometrically dated to determine their geologic ages.
This work was carried out by researchers at the University of Alberta and the Carnegie Institution for Science, as well as by other teams of diamond specialists at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, University of Bristol, and the University of Padua. It required many steps, including shipping the diamonds around the world several times, and deployed some of the most precise mass spectrometers and X-ray diffractometers available.
""The study of such rare samples with a variety of measurement techniques required major teamwork. But even more remarkable is how careful analyses of such minute amounts of material can shed light on the evolution of Earth's largest continental landmasses,"" Timmerman explained.
""The age of these inclusions provides a record of when buoyant mantle was added to Gondwana from below, thereby scaffolding, underpinning, and growing the supercontinent"" added Shirey.
Then, about 120 million years ago, the supercontinent once buoyed by the rocks that housed these diamonds started to break up and, eventually, 30 million years later -- around 90 million years ago -- the diamonds -- and the inclusions trapped inside them -- were brought to the Earth's surface in violent volcanic eruptions of diamond-bearing kimberlite magma.
Now, by combining their lab analysis with existing models of tectonic movement and continent migration, the researchers can use these remarkably well-traveled diamonds to understand how material welds continental fragments together from below, stabilizing such a super-sized continental landmass.

Sublithospheric diamond crystallization records the release of melts from subducting oceanic lithosphere at 300–700 km depths1,2 and is especially suited to tracking the timing and effects of deep mantle processes on supercontinents. Here we show that four isotope systems (Rb–Sr, Sm–Nd, U–Pb and Re–Os) applied to Fe-sulfide and CaSiO3 inclusions within 13 sublithospheric diamonds from Juína (Brazil) and Kankan (Guinea) give broadly overlapping crystallization ages from around 450 to 650 million years ago. The intracratonic location of the diamond deposits on Gondwana and the ages, initial isotopic ratios, and trace element content of the inclusions indicate formation from a peri-Gondwanan subduction system. Preservation of these Neoproterozoic–Palaeozoic sublithospheric diamonds beneath Gondwana until its Cretaceous breakup, coupled with majorite geobarometry3,4, suggests that they accreted to and were retained in the lithospheric keel for more than 300 Myr during supercontinent migration. We propose that this process of lithosphere growth—with diamonds attached to the supercontinent keel by the diapiric uprise of depleted buoyant material and pieces of slab crust—could have enhanced supercontinent stability."

New research focused on the quantum structure of elements under extreme conditions has implications for understanding Earth's evolution, interpreting unusual seismic signals, and even the study of exoplanets for insights into habitability.

Deep inside rocky planets like Earth, the behavior of iron can greatly affect the properties of molten rock materials: properties that influenced how Earth formed and evolved.
In fact, the evolution of our entire planet may be driven by the microscopic quantum state of these iron atoms. One special feature of iron is its ""spin state,"" which is a quantum property of the electrons in each iron atom that drives their magnetic behavior and reactivity in chemical reactions. Changes in the spin state can influence whether iron prefers to be in the molten rock or in solid form and how well the molten rock conducts electricity.
Until now, it's been challenging to recreate the extreme conditions in these molten rock materials, called silicate melts, to measure the spin state of iron. Using powerful lasers and ultrafast X-rays, an international team of researchers at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University, Universite Grenoble Alpes, Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation des Lasers Intenses (LULI), and Arizona State University overcame this challenge. They showed that at extremely high pressures and temperatures, the iron in silicate melts mostly has a low-spin state, meaning its electrons stay closer to the center and pair up in their energy levels, making the iron less magnetic and more stable.
The results, published Friday in Science Advances, support the idea that certain types of molten rock might be stable deep inside Earth and other rocky planets, potentially lending a hand in the creation of magnetic fields. The research has potential implications for understanding Earth's evolution, interpreting seismic signals, and even the study of exoplanets.
""In terms of exploring Earth's history, we're investigating processes that took place over 4 billion years ago,"" said collaborator Dan Shim, a researcher at Arizona State. ""The only way to study this is by using modern technology that operates in femtoseconds. The contrast between these immense time scales is both eloquent and startling: it's akin to the idea of a time machine.""
Asteroid bombardment and magmatic oceans
About 4.3 to 4.5 billion years ago, early Earth underwent intense impacts, getting pummeled by asteroids as large as cities. These impacts produced so much heat that they could have completely melted the outer layers of the planet, creating a deep ocean of molten rock.

""It's been theorized that under the immense pressure of these impacts, the molten rock may have became denser than the solid rock,"" said collaborator and SLAC scientist Arianna Gleason. ""This denser magma would have sunk towards the core, capturing the chemical signatures of that era. Some believe remnants of this magma layer may still exist today, holding clues from 4.5 billion years ago. Volcanoes like those in Hawaii could be releasing these ancient chemical signatures, providing us a glimpse into Earth's distant past.""
At shallow depths, molten rock takes up more space than the same material when it's solid. But as you go deeper and the pressure increases, this difference decreases. The inclusion of iron, especially its spin state, plays a big role in determining these properties. Prior research has shown mixed results about the spin state of iron in similar conditions: some studies found a rapid change in iron's spin state under high pressures, while others saw a slower, more gradual change.
This new study provides the first direct look at iron's behavior in real molten rock under extreme conditions.
""While we can glean a lot from studying rocks and fossils, some aspects of Earth's early history are lost because few records from that time exist,"" Shim said. ""That's what makes this study unique. Earth's formation was a tumultuous process, involving intense impacts and resulting in a globally molten rock layer. The pressure in this layer was immense. We study this by simulating the conditions through laboratory experiments.""
At the Matter in Extreme Conditions (MEC) experimental hutch at SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), the team was able to recreate the extreme pressures that would have been found in early Earth's magmatic ocean by blasting samples with powerful lasers that transform the solid material into a silicate melt in a matter of nanoseconds. Then, the scientists used femtosecond X-ray pulses from LCLS to study the electronic structure of elements like iron under these extreme conditions, providing insights into how electronic configurations change under different conditions and revealing that the molten magma did indeed become denser than a solid under specific conditions.
""By understanding Earth's internal dynamics, we can refine models of tectonic movement and other geological phenomena,"" Gleason said. ""Moreover, as Earth's layers are interconnected, these findings have implications for climate science.""
Understanding our planet

In this research the team concentrated on low iron content melts. But as material rains down towards the Earth's center, it's theorized to absorb more iron, making it denser. To follow up, the team plans to study melts with higher iron content. They also hope to experiment with melts containing some water, furthering our understanding of Earth's water cycle and climate.
The research could also shed light on peculiar seismic velocities deep within Earth's mantle. These anomalies have puzzled scientists for decades. Some theories suggest these zones could be remnants of magma from 4.5 billion years ago, while others believe they result from tectonic plates that have sunk into the Earth's interior, spreading low melting point material. By comparing different hypotheses using seismic imaging, the team aims to determine the origins of these zones and distinguish between ancient and more recent materials.
""As technology advances, we're at the forefront of addressing grand challenges that range from mineralogy to climate science, connecting various research areas,"" said SLAC scientist and collaborator Roberto Alonso-Mori. ""The sheer volume of information we can gather has transformed our capabilities. It's a game-changer. It's exhilarating to develop novel techniques and apply them to pressing questions with such a diverse team.""

Biologists have long known mushrooms of the genus Mycena, commonly known as bonnet mushrooms,as fungi that live off of dead trees and plants. New research from the University of Copenhagen demonstrates that bonnets can also find their ways into young, healthy trees and plants, where they try to cooperate. In doing so, they have made an evolutionary leap which challenges our understanding of the ecological roles of fungi.

Fungal spores float through the air. Thin strands of their mycelia creep along surfaces. They seek out defenseless hosts to wrap themselves around in webs of fungal growth. Their victims can then be used to satisfy their own need to devour and disperse. That fungi have begun to invade the living is a horrific thought for anyone who ever thought that fungi only dined upon the dead. Or, at least for those who stream The Last of Us, a post-apocalyptic series in which humans battle relentless fungal-infected zombies.
Fortunately, reality is rarely so dramatic. But after Danish mycologists targeted local Mycena, known as bonnet mushrooms, it turned out that certain similarities emerged nevertheless. New research from the University of Copenhagen's Department of Biology suggests that this genus of fungi, which has traditionally been considered saprotrophic -- i.e., a decomposer of nonliving organic matter -- is in the midst of an evolutionary leap.
""Using DNA studies, we found that Mycena fungiare consistently found in the roots of living plant hosts. This suggests that bonnets are in the process of an evolutionary development, from uniquely being decomposers of nonliving plant material to being invaders of living plants, under favourable conditions,"" explains Christoffer Bugge Harder, the study's lead author.
The research also demonstrates that some of these bonnet mushrooms species even show early signs of being able to act as mutualists -- i.e., live in symbiosis with trees. Unlike the terrifying fungi in The Last of Us, the researchers believe that Mycena are primarily out to do good, as seen from the plant's perspective. This comes in the form of a kind of evolutionary courtship in which they live in harmony with their living hosts.
""We see that a some Mycena appear to exchange nitrogen, an indispensable nutrient for plants, with carbon from plants,"" says the researcher.
""Once having penetrated a living plant, fungi can choose three strategies. They can be harmful parasites and suck the life out of their new hosts; they can lurk like vultures, waiting harmlessly for the plant to die, and be the first to feast upon the ""carrion""; or, they can begin working together. Some Mycena species are gradually developing the ability to collaborate, though it has yet to be finely tuned,"" says Christoffer Bugge Harder.

Good deeds challenge traditional roles
""Other fungi, the Amanita genus for example, are known to work together with living plants, an ability that they developed many millions of years ago. But Amanita have long since lost their ability to survive without their hosts. And that's how we traditionally divided fungi into strictly separate ecological groups: mutualistic, parasitic or saprophytic,"" explains Christoffer Bugge Harder.
Mycena seem to fall somewhere in between the ecological niches.
""The strict division has been increasingly called into question, and our Mycena research supports a blurring of the lines. Some Mycena have found their own solution and span several different ecological roles,"" says Harder.
By looking at carbon isotopes in Mycena, the researchers were able to conclude that these fungi are saprotrophic decomposers, as well as mutualistic. And perhaps even parasitic.
""Mycena are opportunists. Unlike Amanita, they can easily grow without needing to invade plants, but should the opportunity arise, it's a nifty bonus. They also seek out living roots, where they have nitrogen to offer -- as fungi can take up nitrogen easier than a tree -- for a reasonable price,"" explains Christoffer Bugge Harder.

Payment comes either in the form of carbon from the host while it is living, or when their friendly host dies, and the patient decomposer gets to work. Or perhaps both.
Seizing a human-created opportunity
The favourable conditions sought after by Mycena seem to be related to human activity.
""It is reasonable to believe that we humans have played a role in this adaptation, because our monocultural plantations, stands of forest for example, have provided fungi with optimal conditions for adapting. The fungi seem to have seized upon this opportunity,"" he says.
""Specialists thrive in old-growth forest. In this scenario, there aren't many chances for Mycena to settle on living trees because specialized fungi are already present in this natural setting and don't allow others in,"" says the mycologist.
On the other hand, human cultivated homogeneous plantations with young plants of the same age give Mycena a chance, because specialized fungi have yet to establish themselves. The same applies to harsh environments, such as in the Arctic, or disturbed environments, e.g., where there are many grazing animals about.
""These places present challenging conditions for many organisms, but Mycena are among those that seem to benefit,"" says Christoffer Bugge Harder.
Additional info: Fear not fungi
Recent research has demonstrated that many trees bear the seeds of their own destruction -- or at least those of an effective funeral director, as some of the fungi that thrive at their roots are also ready to begin decomposing them once they die.
After we humans die, fungi often play an important role in our decomposition as well. However, Christoffer Bugge Harder assures that we should not be worried about fungi invading us while we are still alive.
""The human body, unlike trees, is exceptionally adept at protecting us from the enormous amounts of spores that we are exposed to on a daily basis,"" he says
Nevertheless, there has been an increased global focus on fungal infections as a threat to human health in recent years. This is because an essential aspect of the human body's defenses is our body heat, which is intolerable to many fungi. There is now speculation that climate change, and rising temperatures in particular, could lead to an adaptation in the fungal kingdom that would allow them to survive at our body temperature.
""It isn't inconceivable that groups of fungi relevant to the ecological niche of humans could develop. But, there are lots of fungi in tropical regions which have already adapted to high temperatures. When they're not in our bodies anyway, it is due to our effective immune system. So, I don't see any reason to fear fungi -- or at least not worry about Mycena,"" says Christoffer Bugge Harder
Facts: Mycena
Most species of the Mycena genus are small, often only a few centimeters wide. Mycena caps are conical or bell-shaped and look like their common namesake -- bonnets. Most are brown or gray but can also be whitish or almost transparent.
The fungi are generally not edible and can lead to poisoning and slight hallucinations.
Facts: The fungal kingdom's three ecological niches  Species that have specialized in living off of nonliving vegetation for millions of years are known as saprotophic fungi. Species that feed on living vegetation are called parasitic fungi. Fungi that coexist symbiotically with living trees and plants and exchange nutrients with their host are known as mutualistic.However, the traditionally strict division of fungi into three ecological niches is increasingly being called into question. Mycena is a new example of a fungus that blurs the lines.
Facts: Evidence of collaboration
Isotopes are versions of a chemical element that have a different number of neutrons, and therefore can be light or heavy depending on their composition.
For example, as trees and mutualistic fungi work together, a larger proportion of heavy nitrogen isotopes are left in the fungi, as heavy isotopes are more difficult to move.
Because they are left to a greater extent when a fungus has shared nitrogen with its host plant, it is something that researchers can measure.
Facts: PCR and DNA sequencing used to find the Mycena
Using the PCR method that most people are familiar with from viral testing, the researchers found Mycena in samples of living trees in forests, meadows and Arctic mountain heaths around the world. In the method, strands of DNA are propagated when present in a sample so that they can be easily identified.
By sequencing the DNA strands so that part of the code is known, researchers were then able to search international databases of the most known fungal DNA and in doing so, determine whether the samples contained Mycena, for example.

Sequences of assumed saprotrophs have been amplified from plant root interiors, and several saprotrophic genera can invade and interact with host plants in laboratory growth experiments. However, it is uncertain if root invasion by saprotrophic fungi is a widespread phenomenon and if laboratory interactions mirror field conditions. Here, we focused on the widespread and speciose saprotrophic genus Mycena and performed (1) a systematic survey of their occurrences (in ITS1/ITS2 datasets) in mycorrhizal roots of 10 plant species, and (2) an analysis of natural abundances of 13C/15N stable isotope signatures of Mycena basidiocarps from five field locations to examine their trophic status. We found that Mycena was the only saprotrophic genus consistently found in 9 out of 10 plant host roots, with no indication that the host roots were senescent or otherwise vulnerable. Furthermore, Mycena basidiocarps displayed isotopic signatures consistent with published 13C/15N profiles of both saprotrophic and mutualistic lifestyles, supporting earlier laboratory‐based studies. We argue that Mycena are widespread latent invaders of healthy plant roots and that Mycena species may form a spectrum of interactions besides saprotrophy also in the field."

The fossils of a 170-million-year-old ancient marine reptile from the Age of Dinosaurs have been identified as the oldest-known mega-predatory pliosaur -- a group of ocean-dwelling reptiles closely related to the famous long-necked plesiosaurs. The findings are rare and add new knowledge to the evolution of plesiosaurs. The study has been published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The fossils were found 40 years ago in north-eastern France. An international team of palaeontologists from the Naturkunde-Museum Bielefeld in Germany, the Institute of Paleobiology of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, Poland, the Natural History Museum in Luxembourg and The Museum of Evolution at Uppsala University in Sweden have now analysed them and identified them as a new pliosaur genus: Lorrainosaurus.
Pliosaurs were a type of plesiosaur with short necks and massive skulls. They appeared over 200 million years ago, but remained minor components of marine ecosystems until suddenly developing into enormous apex predators. The new study shows that this adaptive shift followed feeding niche differentiation and the global decline of other predatory marine reptiles over 170 million years ago.
Lorrainosaurus is the oldest large-bodied pliosaur represented by an associated skeleton. It had jaws over 1.3 m long with large conical teeth and a bulky 'torpedo-shaped' body propelled by four flipper-like limbs.
""Lorrainosaurus was one of the first truly huge pliosaurs. It gave rise to a dynasty of marine reptile mega-predators that ruled the oceans for around 80 million years,"" explains Sven Sachs, a researcher at the Naturkunde-Museum Bielefeld, who led the study.
This giant reptile probably reached over 6 m from snout to tail, and lived during the early Middle Jurassic period. Intriguingly, very little is known about plesiosaurs from that time.
""Our identification of Lorrainosaurus as one of the earliest mega-predatory pliosaurs demonstrates that these creatures emerged immediately after a landmark restructuring of marine predator ecosystems across the Early-to-Middle Jurassic boundary, some 175 to 171 million years ago. This event profoundly affected many marine reptile groups and brought mega-predatory pliosaurids to dominance over 'fish-like' ichthyosaurs, ancient marine crocodile relatives, and other large-bodied predatory plesiosaurs,"" adds Daniel Madzia from the Institute of Paleobiology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, who co-led the study.

Pliosaurs were some of the most successful marine predators of their time.
""Famous examples, such as Pliosaurus and Kronosaurus -- some of the world's largest pliosaurs -- were absolutely enormous with body-lengths exceeding 10 m. They were ecological equivalents of today's Killer whales and would have eaten a range of prey including squid-like cephalopods, large fish and other marine reptiles. These have all been found as preserved gut contents,"" said senior co-author Benjamin Kear, Curator of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Researcher in Palaeontology at The Museum of Evolution, Uppsala University.
The recovered bones and teeth of Lorrainosaurus represent remnants of what was once a complete skeleton that decomposed and was dispersed across the ancient sea floor by currents and scavengers.
""The remains were unearthed in 1983 from a road cutting near Metz in Lorraine, north-eastern France. Palaeontology enthusiasts from the Association minéralogique et paléontologique d'Hayange et des environs recognised the significance of their discovery and donated the fossils to the Natural History Museum in Luxembourg,"" said co-author Ben Thuy, Curator at the Natural History Museum in Luxembourg.
Other than a brief report published in 1994, the fossils of Lorrainosaurus remained obscure until this new study re-evaluated the finds. Lorrainosaurus indicates that the reign of gigantic mega-predatory pliosaurs must have commenced earlier than previously thought, and was locally responsive to major ecological changes affecting marine environments covering what is now western Europe during the early Middle Jurassic.
""Lorrainosaurus is thus a critical addition to our knowledge of ancient marine reptiles from a time in the Age of Dinosaurs that has as yet been incompletely understood,"" says Benjamin Kear.

However, the timescale of their ‘defining’ trait evolution is incompletely understood because the fossil record of gigantic pliosaurids is scarce prior to the late-Middle Jurassic (Callovian), ~ 165.3 Ma. Here, we pinpoint the appearance of large body size and robust dentitions to early-Middle Jurassic (Bajocian) pliosaurids from northeastern France and Switzerland. These specimens include a new genus that sheds light on the nascent diversification of macropredatory pliosaurids occurring shortly after the Early-Middle Jurassic transition, around ~ 171 Ma. Furthermore, our multivariate assessment of dental character states shows that the first gigantic pliosaurids occupied different morphospace from coeval large-bodied rhomaleosaurid plesiosaurs, which were dominant in the Early Jurassic but declined during the mid-Jurassic, possibly facilitating the radiation and subsequent ecomorph acme of pliosaurids. Finally, we posit that while the emergence of macropredatory pliosaurids was apparently coordinated with regional faunal turnover in the epeiric basins of Europe, it paralleled a globally protracted extinction of other higher trophic-level marine reptiles that was not completed until after the earliest-Late Jurassic, ~ 161.5 Ma."

It's a familiar story to many of us: In prehistoric times, men were hunters and women were gatherers. Women were not physically capable of hunting because their anatomy was different from men. And because men were hunters, they drove human evolution.

But that story's not true, according to research by University of Delaware anthropology professor Sarah Lacy, which was recently published in Scientific American and in two papers in the journal American Anthropologist.
Lacy and her colleague Cara Ocobock from the University of Notre Dame examined the division of labor according to sex during the Paleolithic era, approximately 2.5 million to 12,000 years ago. Through a review of current archaeological evidence and literature, they found little evidence to support the idea that roles were assigned specifically to each sex. The team also looked at female physiology and found that women were not only physically capable of being hunters, but that there is little evidence to support that they were not hunting.
Lacy is a biological anthropologist who studies the health of early humans, and Ocobock is a physiologist who makes analogies between modern day and the fossil record. Friends in graduate school, they collaborated after ""complaining about a number of papers that had come out that used this default null hypothesis that cavemen had strong gendered division of labor, the males hunt, females gather things. We were like, 'Why is that the default? We have so much evidence that that's not the case,'"" Lacy said.
The researchers found examples of equality for both sexes in ancient tools, diet, art, burials and anatomy.
""People found things in the past and they just automatically gendered them male and didn't acknowledge the fact that everyone we found in the past has these markers, whether in their bones or in stone tools that are being placed in their burials. We can't really tell who made what, right? We can't say, 'Oh, only males flintknap,' because there's no signature left on the stone tool that tells us who made it,"" Lacy said, referring to the method by which stone tools were made. ""But from what evidence we do have, there appears to be almost no sex differences in roles.""
The team also examined the question of whether anatomical and physiological differences between men and women prevented women from hunting. They found that men have an advantage over women in activities requiring speed and power, such as sprinting and throwing, but that women have an advantage over men in activities requiring endurance, such as running. Both sets of activities were essential to hunting in ancient times.

The team highlighted the role of the hormone estrogen, which is more prominent in women than men, as a key component in conferring that advantage. Estrogen can increase fat metabolism, which gives muscles a longer-lasting energy source and can regulate muscle breakdown, preventing muscles from wearing down. Scientists have traced estrogen receptors, proteins that direct the hormone to the right place in the body, back to 600 million years ago.
""When we take a deeper look at the anatomy and the modern physiology and then actually look at the skeletal remains of ancient people, there's no difference in trauma patterns between males and females, because they're doing the same activities,"" Lacy said.
During the Paleolithic era, most people lived in small groups. To Lacy, the idea that only part of the group would hunt didn't make sense.
""You live in such a small society. You have to be really, really flexible,"" she said. ""Everyone has to be able to pick up any role at any time. It just seems like the obvious thing, but people weren't taking it that way.""
Man the Hunter
The theory of men as hunters and women as gatherers first gained notoriety in 1968, when anthropologists Richard B. Lee and Irven DeVore published Man the Hunter, a collection of scholarly papers presented at a symposium in 1966. The authors made the case that hunting advanced human evolution by adding meat to prehistoric diets, contributing to the growth of bigger brains, compared to our primate cousins. The authors assumed all hunters were male.

Lacy points to that gender bias by previous scholars as a reason why the concept became widely accepted in academia, eventually spreading to popular culture. Television cartoons, feature films, museum exhibits and textbooks reinforced the idea. When female scholars published research to the contrary, their work was largely ignored or devalued.
""There were women who were publishing about this in the '70s, '80s and '90s, but their work kept getting relegated to, 'Oh, that's a feminist critique or a feminist approach,'"" Lacy said. ""This was before any of the work on genetics and a lot of the work on physiology and the role of estrogen had come out. We wanted to both lift back up the arguments that they had already made and add to it all the new stuff.""
Lacy said the ""man the hunter"" theory continues to influence the discipline. While she acknowledges that much more research needs to be done about the lives of prehistoric people -- especially women -- she hopes her view that labor was divided among both sexes will become the default approach for research in the future.
For 3 million years, males and females both participated in subsistence gathering for their communities, and dependence on meat and hunting was driven by both sexes, Lacy said.
""It's not something that only men did and that therefore male behavior drove evolution,"" she said. ""What we take as de facto gender roles today are not inherent, do not characterize our ancestors. We were a very egalitarian species for millions of years in many ways.""

We see it used as the default hypothesis in anatomical and physiological reconstructions of the past as well as studies of modern people evoking evolutionary explanations. However, the idea of a strict sexual labor division in the Paleolithic is an assumption with little supporting evidence, which reflects a failure to question how modern gender roles color our reconstructions of the past. Here we present examples to support women's roles as hunters in the past as well as challenge oft‐cited interpretations of the material culture. Such evidence includes stone tool function, diet, art, anatomy and paleopathology, and burials. By pulling together the current state of the archaeological evidence along with the modern human physiology presented in the accompanying paper (Ocobock and Lacy, this issue), we argue that not only are women well‐suited to endurance activities like hunting, but there is little evidence to support that they were not hunting in the Paleolithic. Going forward, paleoanthropology should embrace the idea that all sexes contributed equally to life in the past, including via hunting activities."

It's said that a dog is a man's best friend, but the wild dingo is much maligned in Australia. This may not always have been the case though, with new research led by experts at The Australian National University and The University of Western Australia suggesting that dingoes were buried -- and even domesticated -- by First Nations people prior to European colonisation.

The researchers examined remains at the Curracurrang archaeological site, south of Sydney, where radiocarbon dating of dingo bones revealed the animals were buried alongside humans as far back as 2,000 years ago.
The care taken to bury the animals suggests a closer relationship between humans and dingoes than many previously realised, according to lead researcher Dr Loukas Koungoulos.
""Not all camp dingoes were given burial rites, but in all areas in which the burials are recorded, the process and methods of disposal are identical or almost identical to those associated with human rites in the same area,"" Dr Koungoulos said.
""This reflects the close bond between people and dingoes and their almost-human status.""
The burials weren't the only sign that Australia's First Peoples domesticated wild dingoes, however, with severely worn teeth found at the site suggesting a diet heavy in large bones, likely from scraps from human meals.
The researchers also identified remains of dingoes of varying ages at the site -- from pups to animals aged six to eight years. This shows that First Nations people didn't just care for young dingoes before they returned to the wild, but that they built much more substantial relationships, the researchers argued.

""These findings mark an important development in our understanding of the relationship between Australia's First Peoples and dingoes,"" co-author Professor Susan O'Connor said.
""By the time Europeans settled in Australia, the bond between dingoes and Indigenous people was entrenched. This is well known by Indigenous people and has been documented by observers.
""Our work shows that they had long-lasting relationships prior to European colonisation, not just the transient, temporary associations recorded during the colonial era.""
The research is published in PLOS One.

Dingoes were primarily wild animals but a number resided in Aboriginal people’s camps. Traditionally, these individuals were taken from wild litters before weaning and raised by Aboriginal people. It is generally believed that these dingoes were not directly provided for, and upon sexual maturity, returned to reproduce in the wild. However, some died while in the company of people and, were buried in occupation sites. This Australian practice parallels the burial of domestic dogs in many regions of the Asia-Pacific and beyond but has attracted very little research. We explore the historical and archaeological evidence for dingo burial, examining its different forms, chronological and geographic distribution, and cultural significance. Dingoes were usually buried in the same manner as Aboriginal community members and often in areas used for human burial, sometimes alongside people. This practice probably occurred from the time of their introduction until soon after European colonisation. We present a case study of dingo burials from Curracurrang Rockshelter (NSW) which provides insights into the lives of ancient tame dingoes, and suggests that domestication and genetic continuity between successive camp-dwelling generations may have occurred prior to European contact."

A team of scientists from the Universities of Granada and Cambridge, as well as the Government of Catalonia, have identified the oldest pieces of Baltic amber ever found on the Iberian Peninsula, revealing that this luxury material used in jewellery and handicrafts around the world was already being imported more than 5,000 years ago.

The research was led by UGR lecturer Mercedes Murillo-Barroso and involved the collaboration of Marcos Martinón-Torres of the University of Cambridge and Araceli Martín Cólliga of the Government of Catalonia. According to Murillo-Barroso, the work ""allows us to say with confidence that the arrival of Baltic amber on the Iberian Peninsula occurred at least in the 4th millennium BC, more than a millennium earlier than we thought, and that it was probably part of wider trade networks linked to the south of France.""
Trade is one of the many mechanisms through which we establish social relations, and often the objects that are exchanged are not necessarily consumer goods needed to live, but rather decorative, luxury or symbolic objects. Sometimes, especially in adverse conditions, having trade networks means having a network of mutual support, but these trade networks can also generate social inequalities and relations of dependency, especially if not all the community enjoys equal access to the networks or if the objects exchanged are unequal.
In prehistoric times, amber, a fossil resin, was certainly not a raw material necessary for the development of daily life, but it was highly valued and was exchanged via the extensive trade networks that were established. The use of the multiple amber deposits on the Iberian Peninsula since the Upper Palaeolithic has been documented and, thanks to research carried out by archaeologists over the years, we know that from the 4th millennium BC onwards Sicilian amber began to reach the Iberian Peninsula through Mediterranean trade networks. However, until now it was believed that Baltic amber did not reach the Peninsula until the 2nd millennium BC, at which point it would become the primary raw material, replacing other types of amber such as Peninsular or Sicilian amber.
Regarding their research article, published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports, Mercedes Murillo-Barroso affirms: ""we present the standard infrared spectroscopy analysis of an amber bead of Baltic origin found at the Cova del Frare site in a context dated between 3634-3363 cal BC.""
""The site, which is truly exceptional, illustrates the transition between the Middle Neolithic of the 'Sepulcrand the Late Neolithic of Véraza,"" explains Araceli Martín Cólliga, director of the excavations at the site.
""As there are no written documents from prehistoric times, the only way to study human activity is through archaeological remains. To study the transport and exchange of materials, we use very precise analytical techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy, which give us a kind of fingerprint of the amber deposits and objects,"" says Mercedes Murillo-Barroso.
Based on a large amount of data and this type of analysis, combined with other bodies of archaeological information, the study confirms that Baltic amber arrived in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula as early as the Neolithic, which is ""something that must be understood in the context of trade during this period of transition and change, either by agents of a declining 'Sepulcres de Fossa' culture, or by those who would set new cultural trends at the end of the Neolithic, led by the Véraza groups of Catalonia and southern France, and not necessarily as direct contact with northern Europe."" In fact, there is currently no evidence of Baltic amber crossing the Ebro at such an early date into the southern Iberian Peninsula, where the use of Sicilian amber was predominant as a result of the Mediterranean networks.
The Baltic region is home to what is perhaps the best amber in the world for use in jewellery. Indeed, it was highly sought after in classical Rome and now sustains a whole industry, for example in Poland. We now know that it began to arrive in Iberia as early as the 4th millennium BC, and that it gradually replaced Peninsular and Sicilian amber.
""This finding undoubtedly has important implications for our understanding of early exchange networks of exotic materials and their influence on social structures,"" explains University of Cambridge professor Marcos Martinón-Torres.

For decades, climate scientists have warned that changes resulting from greenhouse gas emissions is causing worsening and more frequent severe weather patterns, with many studies focusing on trends since the start of the Industrial Revolution.

New research by Rowan University climate scientist Dr. Andra Garner indicates that there have been great changes to Atlantic hurricanes in just the past 50 years, with storms developing and strengthening faster.
An assistant professor of environmental science in Rowan's School of Earth & Environment, Garner documented this week in the journal Nature Scientific Reports (""Observed Increases in North Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Peak Intensification Rates"") that from 1971 through 2020, intensification rates from Atlantic hurricanes have changed as human-caused greenhouse gas emissions warmed the planet and its oceans.
Atlantic hurricanes developed faster, from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a major Category 3 or stronger, in a 24-period than they did between 1970 and 1990 and they are now more likely to strengthen faster along the east coast of the U.S. than they were during that period, Garner found. She also concluded that better communication methods are needed to warn at-risk communities as it's difficult to predict when, exactly, hurricanes will strengthen fastest.
Garner showed that from 2001 through 2020, considered for the study's purpose the ""modern era,"" that hurricane intensification rates were up to 28.7 percent greater than they were from 1971 through 1990, a period she identified as the ""historical era.""
""In the modern era, it is about as likely for hurricanes to intensify by at least 57 mph in 24 hours, and more likely for hurricanes to intensify by at least 23 mph within 24 hours than it was for storms to intensify by these amounts in 36 hours in the historical era,"" she said. ""The number of times that hurricanes strengthen from a Category 1 storm (or weaker) into a major hurricane (Category 3 or greater) within 36 hours has also more than doubled in the modern era relative to the historical era.""
Garner said ever-warming ocean waters, such as the record-high temperatures reported this summer off the coast of Florida, are especially troubling, because tropical storms feed off energy in ocean water and the warmer the water, the greater the amount of energy such storms can draw.

For example, she said, September's Hurricane Lee, a massive Category 5 that was the third-fastest intensifying storm in recorded history, virtually exploded because of the unnaturally warm Atlantic waters.
""More than 90 percent of the warming we're seeing from human-caused greenhouse gases goes into our oceans,"" Garner said.
Based on data from the National Hurricane Center, Garner's research shows a pattern of rapid escalation that is quickly changing.
""The increase in the number of times hurricanes turned from Category 1 or weaker to a major storm, (Category 3 or greater), is particularly concerning, since major hurricanes often produce the most damage in our coastal communities,"" she said.
Ultimately, she said, proof of quicker intensifying hurricanes as the planet has warmed should serve as a warning that humans must heed.
""One of the messages from this work is that there is an urgency,"" Garner said. ""If we don't make some pretty big changes and rapidly move away from fossil fuels, this is something we can expect to see worsen in the future.""

An analysis of observed maximum changes in wind speed for Atlantic TCs from 1971 to 2020 indicates that TC intensification rates have already changed as anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have warmed the planet and oceans. Mean maximum TC intensification rates are up to 28.7% greater in a modern era (2001–2020) compared to a historical era (1971–1990). In the modern era, it is about as likely for TCs to intensify by at least 50 kts in 24 h, and more likely for TCs to intensify by at least 20 kts within 24 h than it was for TCs to intensify by these amounts in 36 h in the historical era. Finally, the number of TCs that intensify from a Category 1 hurricane (or weaker) into a major hurricane within 36 h has more than doubled in the modern era relative to the historical era. Significance tests suggest that it would have been statistically impossible to observe the number of TCs that intensified in this way during the modern era if rates of intensification had not changed from the historical era."

Since the 1980s, researchers have observed significant periods of unrest in a region of California's Eastern Sierra Nevada mountains characterized by swarms of earthquakes as well as the ground inflating and rising by almost half an inch per year during these periods. The activity is concerning because the area, called the Long Valley Caldera, sits atop a massive dormant supervolcano. Seven hundred and sixty thousand years ago, the Long Valley Caldera was formed in a violent eruption that sent 650 cubic kilometers of ash into the air -- a volume that could cover the entire Los Angeles area in a layer of sediment 1 kilometer thick.

What is behind the increased activity in the last few decades? Could it be that the area is preparing to erupt again? Or could the uptick in activity actually be a sign that the risk of a massive eruption is decreasing?
To answer these questions, Caltech researchers have created the most detailed underground images to date of the Long Valley Caldera, reaching depths up to 10 kilometers within the Earth's crust. These high-resolution images reveal the structure of the earth beneath the caldera and show that the recent seismic activity is a result of fluids and gases being released as the area cools off and settles down.
The work was conducted in the laboratory of Zhongwen Zhan (PhD '14), professor of geophysics. A paper describing the research appears in the journal Science Advances on October 18.
""We don't think the region is gearing up for another supervolcanic eruption, but the cooling process may release enough gas and liquid to cause earthquakes and small eruptions,"" says Zhan. ""For example, in May 1980, there were four magnitude 6 earthquakes in the region alone.""
The high-resolution image shows that the volcano's magma chamber is covered by a hardened lid of crystallized rock, formed as the liquid magma cools down and solidifies.
To create underground images, the researchers infer what the subsurface environment looks like by measuring seismic waves from earthquakes. Earthquakes generate of two types of seismic waves: primary (P-waves) and secondary (S-waves). Both kinds of waves travel at different speeds through different materials -- waves are slowed down by elastic materials like liquids but travel quickly through very rigid materials like rock. Using seismometers at various locations allows one to measure discrepancies in the timing of the waves and determine the characteristics of the materials -- how elastic or rigid -- they traveled through. In this way, researchers can create images of the subsurface environment.

Though there are several dozen seismometers placed throughout the Eastern Sierra region, Zhan's technique utilizes fiber optic cables (like those that provide internet) to make seismic measurements in a process called distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). The 100-kilometer stretch of cable used to image the Long Valley Caldera was comparable to a stretch of 10,000 single-component seismometers. Over a year and a half, the team used the cable to measure more than 2,000 seismic events, most too small to be felt by people. A machine learning algorithm processed those measurements and developed the resulting image.
This study is the first time that such deep, high-resolution images have been created with DAS. Previous images from local tomography studies have either been confined only to the shallow subsurface environment at depths of about 5 kilometers, or covered a larger area in lower resolution.
""This is one of the first demonstrations of how DAS can change our understanding of crustal dynamics,"" says Ettore Biondi, DAS scientist at Caltech and the paper's first author. ""We're excited to apply similar technology to other regions where we are curious about the subsurface environment.""
Next, the team plans to use a 200-kilometer length of cable to image even deeper into the Earth's crust, to around 15 to 20 kilometers deep, where the caldera's magma chamber -- its ""beating heart"" -- is cooling.
The paper is titled ""An upper-crust lid over the Long Valley magma chamber."" In addition to Biondi and Zhan, co-authors are former Caltech postdoctoral fellow Weiqiang Zhu, now of UC Berkeley; Caltech postdoctoral scholar Jiaxuan Li; and former Caltech graduate student Ethan Williams (MS '19, PhD '23), now of the University of Washington. Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation, the Resnick Sustainability Institute at Caltech, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

The mechanism behind the unrest of Long Valley Caldera in California remains highly debated, with recent periods of uplift and seismicity driven either by the release of aqueous fluids from the magma chamber or by the intrusion of magma into the upper crust. We use distributed acoustic sensing data recorded along a 100-kilometer fiber-optic cable traversing the caldera to image its subsurface structure. Our images highlight a definite separation between the shallow hydrothermal system and the large magma chamber located at ~12-kilometer depth. The combination of the geological evidence with our results shows how fluids exsolved through second boiling provide the source of the observed uplift and seismicity."

The analysis of ancient, superdeep diamonds dug up from mines in Brazil and Western Africa, has exposed new processes of how continents evolved and moved during the early evolution of complex life on Earth.

These diamonds that were formed between 650 and 450 million years ago on the base of the supercontinent Gondwana, were analysed by an international team of experts, and have shown how supercontinents such as Gondwana were formed, stabilised, and how they move around the planet.
""Superdeep diamonds are extremely rare and we now know that they can tell us a lot about the whole process of continent formation,"" says Dr Karen Smit of the Wits School of Geosciences, who was part of the study. ""We wanted to date these diamonds to try and understand how the earliest continents formed.""
Formed millions to billions of years ago, diamonds can shine light into the darkest and oldest parts of the Earth's mantle. Continents drift across Earth's surface creating ""supercontinents"" and destroying them. Collectively, these migrations are known as the ""supercontinent cycle"" and diamonds are one of the few minerals strong enough to survive and record these ancient cycles of creation and destruction.
Supercontinents can focus deep oceanic plate subduction -- the driver of plate tectonics -- in very specific regions. Such deep geologic processes, especially in the past, have been very difficult to study directly because the oceanic crust is young, and the continental crust only provides a limited view of Earth's deep workings. Old diamonds offer a direct window into the deep plate tectonic engine and how it might relate to the supercontinent cycle.
By dating the tiny silicate and sulphide inclusions inside the diamonds, the team led by Dr Suzette Timmerman of the University of Bern, Switzerland, dated the diamonds that formed 300 to 700km deep under the base of Gondwana. The goal was to trace how material was added to the keel of the supercontinent. While doing this, the team recognised a previously unknown geologic process. The research was published in Nature on Wednesday, October 18.
""The geochemical analyses and dating of inclusions in the diamonds, combined with existing plate tectonic models of continent migration, showed that diamonds formed at great depths beneath Gondwana when the supercontinent covered the South Pole, between 650-450 million years ago,"" says Smit.

The host rocks to the diamonds became buoyant during diamond formation, transporting subducted mantle material plus the diamonds. This material was added to the base of the root of Gondwana, in essence 'growing' the supercontinent from below.
""Around 120 million years ago, Gondwana started to break apart to form the present oceans such as the Atlantic. At 90 million years ago, the diamonds, carrying trapped tiny inclusions of the host rock, were brought to Earth's surface in violent volcanic eruptions.""
The current locations for these volcanic eruptions are on the continental fragments of Brazil and Western Africa, two of the key components of Gondwana. Thus, the diamonds must have migrated together with different parts of the former supercontinent as it dispersed, ""glued"" to their base.
""This complex history of the diamonds shows that they are remarkably well-travelled, both vertically, and horizontally, within the Earth -- tracing both the formation of the supercontinent and the latter stages of its evolution. The accretion of relatively young material to the roots of the continents thickens and welds together these ancient continental fragments indicating a potential new mode of continent growth.""
Smit conducted the isotope analyses of sulphide inclusions at Carnegie Institution for Science. Smit is now based at the University of the Witwatersrand where she is part of a team developing a new isotope lab and methodologies so that diamond inclusion analyses can ultimately be conducted at Wits.
""We have installed the necessary equipment in 2022 and are working towards getting the highly specialised skills and equipment together so we can do this type of diamond work in South Africa, where previously it could only be done overseas,"" says Smit.
""We need this type of research to understand how continents evolve and move. Without continents there wouldn't be life. This research gives us insight into how continents form, and it links to how life evolved and what makes our planet, Earth, different from other planets.""

Sublithospheric diamond crystallization records the release of melts from subducting oceanic lithosphere at 300–700 km depths1,2 and is especially suited to tracking the timing and effects of deep mantle processes on supercontinents. Here we show that four isotope systems (Rb–Sr, Sm–Nd, U–Pb and Re–Os) applied to Fe-sulfide and CaSiO3 inclusions within 13 sublithospheric diamonds from Juína (Brazil) and Kankan (Guinea) give broadly overlapping crystallization ages from around 450 to 650 million years ago. The intracratonic location of the diamond deposits on Gondwana and the ages, initial isotopic ratios, and trace element content of the inclusions indicate formation from a peri-Gondwanan subduction system. Preservation of these Neoproterozoic–Palaeozoic sublithospheric diamonds beneath Gondwana until its Cretaceous breakup, coupled with majorite geobarometry3,4, suggests that they accreted to and were retained in the lithospheric keel for more than 300 Myr during supercontinent migration. We propose that this process of lithosphere growth—with diamonds attached to the supercontinent keel by the diapiric uprise of depleted buoyant material and pieces of slab crust—could have enhanced supercontinent stability."

About 40,000 years ago, Neanderthals, who had lived for hundreds of thousands of years in the western part of the Eurasian continent, gave way to Homo sapiens, who had arrived from Africa. This replacement was not sudden, and the two species coexisted for a few millennia, resulting in the integration of Neanderthal DNA into the genome of Sapiens. Researchers at the University of Geneva (UNIGE) have analyzed the distribution of the portion of DNA inherited from Neanderthals in the genomes of humans (Homo sapiens) over the last 40,000 years. These statistical analyses revealed subtle variations in time and geographical space. This work, published in the journal Science Advances, helps us to understand the common history of these two species.

Thanks to genome sequencing and comparative analysis, it is established that Neanderthals and Sapiens interbred and that these encounters were sometimes fruitful, leading to the presence of about 2% of DNA of Neanderthal origin in present-day Eurasians. However, this percentage varies slightly between regions of Eurasia, since DNA from Neanderthals is somewhat more abundant in the genomes of Asian populations than in those of European populations.
One hypothesis to explain this difference is that natural selection would not have had the same effect on genes of Neanderthal origin in Asian and European populations. Mathias Currat's team, senior lecturer in the Department of Genetics and Evolution at the UNIGE Faculty of Science, is working on another hypothesis. His previous work, based on computer simulations, suggests that such differences could be explained by migratory flows: when a migrant population hybridizes with a local population, in their area of cohabitation, the proportion of DNA of the local population tends to increase with distance from the point of departure of the migrant population.
Europe: a territory shared by both species
In the case of Sapiens and Neanderthals, the hypothesis is that the further one moves away from Africa, Homo sapiens' point of origin, the greater the proportion of DNA from Neanderthal, a population mainly located in Europe. To test this hypothesis, the authors used a database made available by Harvard Medical School that includes more than 4,000 genomes from individuals who have lived in Eurasia over the past 40 millennia.
''Our study is mainly focused on European populations since we are obviously dependent on the discovery of bones and the state of conservation of DNA. It turns out that archaeological excavations have been much more numerous in Europe, which greatly facilitates the study of the genomes of European populations,'' explains Claudio Quilodrán, senior research and teaching assistant in the Department of Genetics and Evolution at the UNIGE Faculty of Science, and co-first author of the study.
Statistical analyses revealed that, in the period following the dispersal of Homo sapiensfrom Africa, the genomes of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who lived in Europe contained a slightly higher proportion of DNA of Neanderthal origin than the genomes of those who lived in Asia. This result is contrary to the current situation but in agreement with paleontological data, since the presence of Neanderthals was mainly reported in western Eurasia (no Neanderthal bones have been discovered further east than the Altai region of Siberia).
The arrival of Anatolian farmers modifies genomes
Subsequently, during the transition to the Neolithic, i.e. the transition from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle to the farmer lifestyle, 10,000 to 5,000 years ago, the study shows a decline in the proportion of DNA of Neanderthal origin in the genomes of European populations, resulting in a slightly lower percentage than that of Asian populations (as currently observed). This decrease coincided with the arrival in Europe of the first farmers from Anatolia (Turkey's western peninsula) and the Aegean area, who themselves carried a lower proportion of DNA of Neanderthal origin than the inhabitants of Europe at the same time. By mixing with the populations of Europe, the genomes of farmers from Anatolia ''diluted'' Neanderthal DNA a little more.
This study shows that the analysis of ancient genomes, coupled with archaeological data, makes it possible to trace different stages in the history of hybridized species. ''In addition, we are beginning to have enough data to describe more and more precisely the percentage of DNA of Neanderthal origin in the genome of Sapiens at certain periods of prehistory. Our work can therefore serve as a reference for future studies to more easily detect genetic profiles that deviate from the average and might therefore disclose an advantageous or disadvantageous effect,'' concludes Mathias Currat, last author of the study.

Both species coexisted and interbred, leading to slightly higher introgression in East Asians than in Europeans. This distinct ancestry level has been argued to result from selection, but range expansions of modern humans could provide an alternative explanation. This hypothesis would lead to spatial introgression gradients, increasing with distance from the expansion source. We investigate the presence of Neanderthal introgression gradients after past human expansions by analyzing Eurasian paleogenomes. We show that the out-of-Africa expansion resulted in spatial gradients of Neanderthal ancestry that persisted through time. While keeping the same gradient orientation, the expansion of early Neolithic farmers contributed decisively to reducing the Neanderthal introgression in European populations compared to Asian populations. This is because Neolithic farmers carried less Neanderthal DNA than preceding Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. This study shows that inferences about past human population dynamics can be made from the spatiotemporal variation in archaic introgression."

Over 4,800 years in the Northern Rockies during wet periods and dry periods, subalpine forests consistently recovered from wildfires, growing back vegetation and leaving evidence of their resilience in lake sediment cores.

Kyra Clark-Wolf, now a CU Boulder postdoc with the North Central Climate Adaptation Center (NC CASC), led the study as part of her dissertation research. NC CASC is a partnership of CU Boulder and the United States Geological Survey.
""I thought we might see different ecosystem responses to past fires between wet and dry periods,"" said Clark-Wolf. ""But what we found was that there wasn't really a clear difference based on climate, but just a lot of variability within the record, which is something that hasn't been shown before.""
Fires have always been part of subalpine forest ecology in the Northern Rockies, but scientists haven't been able to study forest recovery from those forests in detail -- until now. Results from the new analysis of lake sediment cores from a Montana subalpine lake, published today in the Journal of Ecology, were surprising.
The results detail the remarkable resilience of Northern Rockies subalpine forests to fire in the past. But the research also raises an important question: How resilient will these forests fare in the future?
""As we look to the present into the future, we know that our climate conditions are increasingly getting outside of the range of variability that we've experienced in recent millennia,"" said Phil Higuera, former CIRES visiting fellow, director of the University of Montana's Paleoecology and Fire Ecology Lab, and a co-author of the study. ""Global temperatures are getting warmer and conditions are getting drier.""
Scientists often rely on tree-ring records to understand the history of fire in forests. Yet, fires in subalpine forests are rare, burning on average every 100 to 250+ years. These fires typically kill most trees, along with the history they record.

Like tree rings, lake sediment cores act as natural archives, but they document a much larger time frame, producing records that date back thousands of years compared to centuries. As sediment settles into lake bottoms in layers they accumulate, with the oldest at the bottom and youngest at the top. Sediment preserves pollen, charcoal, and other indicators of past ecosystems.
""Lake sediment records integrate everything that's happening on the landscape so we can understand ecosystem responses,"" said Clark-Wolf. ""For example, pollen tells us what types of plants were present on the landscape before and after fires.""
This paper built on another recent study in which the research team created long-term records for 12 subalpine lakes in Montana and Idaho, resulting in a full landscape history of fire in the region. That work showed that present-day fire activity is still well within the range of the variability experienced over the past 2500 years.
Collecting the lake sediment samples in a beautiful subalpine lake was cold, arduous work, Clark-Wolf said. After camping in near-freezing temps, the team set out on an inflatable raft they anchored in the center of the lake. While balancing on the small raft, they'd screw metal rods together to lower a long slender coring tube over 50 feet to the lake bottom. Then, layer after layer, they hand-drilled through years of sediment at the bottom of the lake. The oldest sediment core measured about seven meters long, 7600 years old, with layers indicating time stamps like the Mount St. Helens and Crater Lake eruptions.
After a few days of sediment collection, they brought the 13 cores back to the lab where they sliced the mud-like samples into hundreds of half-centimeter intervals.
""Each one of those slices is a snapshot of the ecosystem over about a 10-year time period,"" said Higuera. ""When we're talking about thousands of years, a 10-year time slice is really high resolution. And that's what allows [Clark-Wolf] to be able to characterize how fires impacted the ecosystem, and how long it took for vegetation [and other ecosystem components] to return to what they were like before each fire occurred.""
Looking ahead, the study concluded that a modest increase in fire activity wouldn't be uncharacteristic for the Northern Rockies subalpine ecosystems -- yet.
""Connecting the dots, it's clear that we expect to see things change in these forests, and given global warming, we clearly expect to see more widespread burning. Eventually burning will likely exceed what these forests have experienced in the past, something we're starting to see in other regions, like the southern Rocky Mountains."" Phil Higuera.

Charcoal particles, pollen grains, element concentrations and stable isotopes of C and N serve as proxies of past changes in fire, vegetation and ecosystem processes such as nitrogen cycling and soil erosion, within a small subalpine forest watershed. A published lake‐level history from Silver Lake provides a local record of palaeohydrology. A trend towards increased effective moisture over the late Holocene coincided with a distinct shift in the pollen assemblage c. 1900 yr BP, resulting from increased subalpine conifer abundance. Fire activity, inferred from peaks in macroscopic charcoal, decreased significantly after 1900 yr BP, from one fire event every 126 yr (83–184 yr, 95% CI) from 4800 to 1900 yr BP, to one event every 223 yr (175–280 yr) from 1900 yr BP to present. Across the record, individual fire events were followed by two distinct decadal‐scale biogeochemical responses, reflecting differences in ecosystem impacts of fires on watershed processes. These distinct biogeochemical responses were interpreted as reflecting fire severity, highlighting (i) erosion, likely from large or high‐severity fires, and (ii) nutrient transfers and enhanced within‐lake productivity, likely from lower severity or patchier fires. Biogeochemical and vegetation proxies returned to pre‐fire values within decades regardless of the nature of fire effects. Synthesis. Palaeorecords of fire and ecosystem responses provide a novel view revealing past variability in fire effects, analogous to spatial variability in fire severity observed within contemporary wildfires. Overall, the palaeorecord highlights ecosystem resilience to fire across long‐term variability in climate and fire activity.

For many people seaweed holds a reputation as a superfood, heralded for its health benefits and sustainability, but it appears our European ancestors were ahead of the game and were consuming the nutrient-rich plant for thousands of years.

Researchers say they have found ""definitive"" archaeological evidence that seaweeds and other local freshwater plants were eaten in the mesolithic, through the Neolithic transition to farming and into the Early Middle Ages, suggesting that these resources, now rarely eaten in Europe, only became marginal much more recently.
The study, published in Nature Communications, reveals that while aquatic resources were exploited, the archaeological evidence for seaweed is only rarely recorded and is almost always considered in terms of non-edible uses like fuel, food wrappings or fertilisers.
Historical accounts report laws related to collection of seaweed in Iceland, Brittany and Ireland dating to the 10th Century, while sea kale is mentioned by Pliny as a sailor's anti-scurvy remedy.
By the 18th Century seaweed was considered as famine food, and although seaweed and freshwater aquatic plants continue to be economically important in parts of Asia, both nutritionally and medicinally, there is little consumption in Europe.
The team, led by archaeologists from the universities of Glasgow and York, examined biomarkers extracted from dental calculus from 74 individuals from 28 archaeological sites across Europe, from north Scotland to southern Spain, which revealed ""direct evidence for widespread consumption of seaweed and submerged aquatic and freshwater plants.""
Samples where biomolecular evidence survived revealed consumption of red, green or brown seaweeds, or freshwater aquatic plants, with one sample from Orkney also containing evidence for a Brassica, most likely sea kale.

There are approximately 10,000 different species of seaweeds in the world, however only 145 species are eaten today, principally in Asia.
The researchers hope that their study will highlight the potential for including more seaweeds and other local freshwater plants in our diets today -- helping Europeans to become healthier and more sustainable.
Karen Hardy, Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology at the University of Glasgow and Principal Investigator of the Powerful Plants project, said: ""Today, seaweed and freshwater aquatic plants are virtually absent from traditional, western diets and their marginalisation as they gradually changed from food to famine resources and animal fodder, probably occurred over a long period of time, as has also been detected elsewhere with some plants.
""Our study also highlights the potential for rediscovery of alternative, local, sustainable food resources that may contribute to addressing the negative health and environmental effects of over-dependence on a small number of mass-produced agricultural products that is a dominant feature of much of today's western diet, and indeed the global long-distance food supply more generally.""
""It is very exciting to be able to show definitively that seaweeds and other local freshwater plants were eaten across a long period in our European past.""
Co author on the paper, Dr Stephen Buckley, from the Department of Archaeology at the University of York, said ""The biomolecular evidence in this study is over three thousand years earlier than historical evidence in the Far East.
""Not only does this new evidence show that seaweed was being consumed in Europe during the Mesolithic Period around 8,000 years ago when marine resources were known to have been exploited, but that it continued into the Neolithic when it is usually assumed that the introduction of farming led to the abandonment of marine dietary resources.
""This strongly suggests that the nutritional benefits of seaweed were sufficiently well understood by these ancient populations that they maintained their dietary link with the sea.""

In contrast, the subsequent Neolithic is characterised by the spread of farming, land ownership, and full sedentism, which lead to the perception of marine resources subsequently representing marginal or famine food or being abandoned altogether even at the furthermost coastal limits of Europe. Here, we examine biomarkers extracted from human dental calculus, using sequential thermal desorption- and pyrolysis-GCMS, to report direct evidence for widespread consumption of seaweed and submerged aquatic and freshwater plants across Europe. Notably, evidence of consumption of these resources extends through the Neolithic transition to farming and into the Early Middle Ages, suggesting that these resources, now rarely eaten in Europe, only became marginal much more recently. Understanding ancient foodstuffs is crucial to reconstructing the past, while a better knowledge of local, forgotten resources is likewise important today."

Surface ice in Greenland has been melting at an increasing rate in recent decades, while the trend in Antarctica has moved in the opposite direction, according to researchers at the University of California, Irvine and Utrecht University in the Netherlands.

For a paper published recently in the American Geophysical Union journal Geophysical Research Letters, the scientists studied the role of Foehn and katabatic winds, downslope gusts that bring warm, dry air into contact with the tops of glaciers. They said that melting of the Greenland ice sheet related to these winds has gone up by more than 10 percent in the past 20 years; the impact of the winds on the Antarctic ice sheet has decreased by 32 percent.
""We used regional climate model simulations to study ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and the results showed that downslope winds are responsible for a significant amount of surface melt of the ice sheets in both regions,"" said co-author Charlie Zender, UCI professor of Earth system science. ""Surface melt leads to runoff and ice shelf hydrofracture that increase freshwater flow to oceans -- causing sea level rise.""
While the impact of the winds is substantial, he said, the distinct behaviors of global warming in the Northern and Southern hemispheres are causing contrasting outcomes in the regions.
In Greenland, wind-driven surface melt is compounded by the massive island ""becoming so warm that sunlight alone (without wind) is enough to melt it,"" according to Zender. The 10 percent growth in wind-driven melt combined with warmer surface air temperatures has resulted in a 34 percent increase in total surface ice melt. He attributes this outcome in part to the influence of global warming on the North Atlantic Oscillation, an index of sea level pressure difference. The shifting of NAO to a positive phase has led to below-normal pressure across high latitudes, ushering warm air over Greenland and other Arctic areas.
The authors found that, in contrast with Greenland, total Antarctic surface melt has decreased by about 15 percent since 2000. The bad news is that this reduction is largely due to 32 percent less downslope wind-generated melt on the Antarctic Peninsula where two vulnerable ice shelves have already collapsed. Zender said it's fortunate that the Antarctic stratospheric ozone hole discovered in the 1980s continues to recover, which temporarily helps to insulate the surface from further melt.
""The ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica keep over 200 feet of water out of the ocean, and their melt has raised global sea level by about three-quarters of an inch since 1992,"" said Zender, who holds a joint appointment in UCI's Department of Computer Science. ""Although Greenland has been the No. 1 driver of sea level rise in recent decades, Antarctica is close behind and catching up and will eventually dominate sea level rise. So it's important to monitor and model melt as both ice sheets deteriorate, including the ways climate change alters the relationship between wind and ice.""
He said he hopes that the research on the role of Foehn and katabatic winds in polar regions will help the climate science community strengthen the physical fidelity of Earth system models.
Zender was joined on this project by Matthew Laffin and Wenshan Wang of UCI's Department of Earth System Science and Melchior van Wessem and Brice Noel of the University of Utrecht's Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research. The researchers received financial support from the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.

A paper in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today describes ""a missing law of nature,"" recognizing for the first time an important norm within the natural world's workings.

In essence, the new law states that complex natural systems evolve to states of greater patterning, diversity, and complexity. In other words, evolution is not limited to life on Earth, it also occurs in other massively complex systems, from planets and stars to atoms, minerals, and more.
Authored by a nine-member team -- leading scientists from the Carnegie Institution for Science, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and Cornell University, and philosophers from the University of Colorado -- the work was funded by the John Templeton Foundation.
""Macroscopic"" laws of nature describe and explain phenomena experienced daily in the natural world. Natural laws related to forces and motion, gravity, electromagnetism, and energy, for example, were described more than 150 years ago.
The new work presents a modern addition -- a macroscopic law recognizing evolution as a common feature of the natural world's complex systems, which are characterised as follows: They are formed from many different components, such as atoms, molecules, or cells, that can be arranged and rearranged repeatedly Are subject to natural processes that cause countless different arrangements to be formed Only a small fraction of all these configurations survive in a process called ""selection for function.""Regardless of whether the system is living or nonliving, when a novel configuration works well and function improves, evolution occurs.
The authors' ""Law of Increasing Functional Information"" states that the system will evolve ""if many different configurations of the system undergo selection for one or more functions.""
""An important component of this proposed natural law is the idea of 'selection for function,'"" says Carnegie astrobiologist Dr. Michael L. Wong, first author of the study.

In the case of biology, Darwin equated function primarily with survival -- the ability to live long enough to produce fertile offspring.
The new study expands that perspective, noting that at least three kinds of function occur in nature.
The most basic function is stability -- stable arrangements of atoms or molecules are selected to continue. Also chosen to persist are dynamic systems with ongoing supplies of energy.
The third and most interesting function is ""novelty"" -- the tendency of evolving systems to explore new configurations that sometimes lead to startling new behaviors or characteristics.
Life's evolutionary history is rich with novelties -- photosynthesis evolved when single cells learned to harness light energy, multicellular life evolved when cells learned to cooperate, and species evolved thanks to advantageous new behaviors such as swimming, walking, flying, and thinking.
The same sort of evolution happens in the mineral kingdom. The earliest minerals represent particularly stable arrangements of atoms. Those primordial minerals provided foundations for the next generations of minerals, which participated in life's origins. The evolution of life and minerals are intertwined, as life uses minerals for shells, teeth, and bones.

Indeed, Earth's minerals, which began with about 20 at the dawn of our Solar System, now number almost 6,000 known today thanks to ever more complex physical, chemical, and ultimately biological processes over 4.5 billion years.
In the case of stars, the paper notes that just two major elements -- hydrogen and helium -- formed the first stars shortly after the big bang. Those earliest stars used hydrogen and helium to make about 20 heavier chemical elements. And the next generation of stars built on that diversity to produce almost 100 more elements.
""Charles Darwin eloquently articulated the way plants and animals evolve by natural selection, with many variations and traits of individuals and many different configurations,"" says co-author Robert M. Hazen of Carnegie Science, a leader of the research.
""We contend that Darwinian theory is just a very special, very important case within a far larger natural phenomenon. The notion that selection for function drives evolution applies equally to stars, atoms, minerals, and many other conceptually equivalent situations where many configurations are subjected to selective pressure.""
The co-authors themselves represent a unique multi-disciplinary configuration: three philosophers of science, two astrobiologists, a data scientist, a mineralogist, and a theoretical physicist.
Says Dr. Wong: ""In this new paper, we consider evolution in the broadest sense -- change over time -- which subsumes Darwinian evolution based upon the particulars of 'descent with modification.'""
""The universe generates novel combinations of atoms, molecules, cells, etc. Those combinations that are stable and can go on to engender even more novelty will continue to evolve. This is what makes life the most striking example of evolution, but evolution is everywhere.""
Among many implications, the paper offers: Understanding into how differing systems possess varying degrees to which they can continue to evolve. ""Potential complexity"" or ""future complexity"" have been proposed as metrics of how much more complex an evolving system might become Insights into how the rate of evolution of some systems can be influenced artificially. The notion of functional information suggests that the rate of evolution in a system might be increased in at least three ways: (1) by increasing the number and/or diversity of interacting agents, (2) by increasing the number of different configurations of the system; and/or 3) by enhancing the selective pressure on the system (for example, in chemical systems by more frequent cycles of heating/cooling or wetting/drying). A deeper understanding of generative forces behind the creation and existence of complex phenomena in the universe, and the role of information in describing them An understanding of life in the context of other complex evolving systems. Life shares certain conceptual equivalencies with other complex evolving systems, but the authors point to a future research direction, asking if there is something distinct about how life processes information on functionality. Aiding the search for life elsewhere: if there is a demarcation between life and non-life that has to do with selection for function, can we identify the ""rules of life"" that allow us to discriminate that biotic dividing line in astrobiological investigations? At a time when evolving AI systems are an increasing concern, a predictive law of information that characterizes how both natural and symbolic systems evolve is especially welcomeLaws of nature -- motion, gravity, electromagnetism, thermodynamics -- etc. codify the general behavior of various macroscopic natural systems across space and time.
The ""law of increasing functional information"" published today complements the 2nd law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy (disorder) of an isolated system increases over time (and heat always flows from hotter to colder objects).

We propose that an additional, hitherto-unarticulated law is required to characterize familiar macroscopic phenomena of our complex, evolving universe. An important feature of the classical laws of physics is the conceptual equivalence of specific characteristics shared by an extensive, seemingly diverse body of natural phenomena. Identifying potential equivalencies among disparate phenomena—for example, falling apples and orbiting moons or hot objects and compressed springs—has been instrumental in advancing the scientific understanding of our world through the articulation of laws of nature. A pervasive wonder of the natural world is the evolution of varied systems, including stars, minerals, atmospheres, and life. These evolving systems appear to be conceptually equivalent in that they display three notable attributes: 1) They form from numerous components that have the potential to adopt combinatorially vast numbers of different configurations; 2) processes exist that generate numerous different configurations; and 3) configurations are preferentially selected based on function. We identify universal concepts of selection—static persistence, dynamic persistence, and novelty generation—that underpin function and drive systems to evolve through the exchange of information between the environment and the system. Accordingly, we propose a “law of increasing functional information”: The functional information of a system will increase (i.e., the system will evolve) if many different configurations of the system undergo selection for one or more functions."

A new study led by scientists at the American Museum of Natural History, Brooklyn College, and the Catalan Institute of Paleontology Miquel Crusafont has reconstructed the well-preserved but damaged skull of a great ape species that lived about 12 million years ago. The species, Pierolapithecus catalaunicus, may be crucial to understanding great ape and human evolution. The researchers describe their findings today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Pierolapithecus catalaunicus, a species from northeastern Spain first described in 2004, was one of a diverse group of now-extinct ape species that lived in Europe around 15 to 7 million years ago. The species is key to understanding the mosaic nature of hominid (great ape and human) evolution because it is known from a cranium and partial skeleton of the same individual -- a rarity in the fossil record.
""Features of the skull and teeth are extremely important in resolving the evolutionary relationships of fossil species, and when we find this material in association with bones of the rest of the skeleton, it gives us the opportunity to not only accurately place the species on the hominid family tree, but also to learn more about the biology of the animal in terms of, for example, how it was moving around its environment,"" said lead author Kelsey Pugh, a research associate in the Museum's Division of Anthropology and a lecturer at Brooklyn College.
Previous work on Pierolapithecus suggests that an upright body plan preceded adaptations that allowed hominids to hang from tree branches and move among them. However, debate persists about the species' evolutionary place, partly due to damage to the cranium.
""One of the persistent issues in studies of ape and human evolution is that the fossil record is fragmentary, and many specimens are incompletely preserved and distorted,"" said co-author Ashley Hammond, associate curator and chair of the Museum's Division of Anthropology. ""This makes it difficult to reach a consensus on the evolutionary relationships of key fossil apes that are essential to understanding ape and human evolution.""
In an effort to bring clarity to these questions, the researchers used CT scans to virtually reconstruct the cranium of Pierolapithecus, compare it to other primate species, and model the evolution of key features of ape facial structure. They found that Pierolapithecus shares similarities in overall face shape and size with both fossilized and living great apes, but it also has distinct facial features not found in other Middle Miocene apes. The results are consistent with the idea that this species represents one of the earliest members of the great apes and human family.
""An interesting output of the evolutionary modeling in the study is that that the cranium of Pierolapithecus is closer in shape and size to the ancestor from which living great apes and humans evolved. On the other hand, gibbons and siamangs (the 'lesser apes') seem to be secondarily derived in relation to size reduction,"" said co-author Sergio Almécija, a senior research scientist in the Museum's Division of Anthropology.

However, there is ongoing debate about this species, partly because the sole known cranium, preserving a nearly complete face, suffers from taphonomic damage. We 1) carried out a micro computerized tomography (CT) based virtual reconstruction of the Pierolapithecus cranium, 2) assessed its morphological affinities using a series of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) morphometric analyses, and 3) modeled the evolution of key aspects of ape face form. The reconstruction clarifies many aspects of the facial morphology of Pierolapithecus . Our results indicate that it is most similar to great apes (fossil and extant) in overall face shape and size and is morphologically distinct from other Middle Miocene apes. Crown great apes can be distinguished from other taxa in several facial metrics (e.g., low midfacial prognathism, relatively tall faces) and only some of these features are found in Pierolapithecus , which is most consistent with a stem (basal) hominid position. The inferred morphology at all ancestral nodes within the hominoid (ape and human) tree is closer to great apes than to hylobatids (gibbons and siamangs), which are convergent with other smaller anthropoids. Our analyses support a hominid ancestor that was distinct from all extant and fossil hominids in overall facial shape and shared many features with Pierolapithecus . This reconstructed ancestral morphotype represents a testable hypothesis that can be reevaluated as new fossils are discovered."

A study by UAB researchers describes the productive forces of the Chalcolithic communities of the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula as being very diverse, both in the type of tasks performed and in intensity, with a high degree of cooperation and no apparent signs of dependence between the different types of settlements or of political centralization. The work, based on the analysis of macrolithic tool data and the additional support of bioarchaeological information, allows to confirm the large ditched enclosure of Valencina de la Concepción (Seville) as a macro-populated area, inhabited by thousands of people, and not only as a place of worship.

The richness and productive diversity of the Chalcolithic communities of the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula, dating back 5,100 to 4,200 years ago, were produced without signs of economic exploitation or marked social hierarchies and with a high degree of cooperation. This economic organization, based on a great variety of resources and tasks, was present in almost all settlements, independently of their type or dimensions, and would have been crucial for the great social, architectural and demographic dynamics and development reached by the societies of the peninsular Copper Age.
This is the conclusion of researchers from the Department of Prehistory of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB) Marina Eguíluz, Selina Delgado-Raack and Roberto Risch in a study published in the Journal of World Prehistory, in which they analysed data on large stone tools (macrolithic artifacts) from the Copper Age to learn about the economic pattern of the different types of settlements that existed.
""Determining whether these settlements were distinguished by specific modes of production, with a characteristic economy between monumental ditched or fortified enclosures versus those located on hills and more open spaces, is fundamental to the ongoing debate on whether or not it is relevant to talk about social complexity when we refer to the Chalcolithic societies of the Iberian Peninsula and their political organization,"" explains Marina Eguíluz.
The Copper Age communities of the Iberian Peninsula produced one of the most important archaeological records of late prehistory, but at the same time also one of the most puzzling for specialists. How and why they achieved this great economic and social complexity, made evident by the number and size of the settlements, the creative capacity reflected in their objects, and the enormous circulation of goods that took place, is still a matter of debate.
Much variability and no signs of political centralization
The study describes the productive forces of these communities based, above all, on the macrolithic artifacts, essential tools for achieving a large part of the tasks undertaken in the Copper Age. The result is the finding of a great variability, both in the type of tasks performed and in their intensity, and without apparent signs of political dependence or centralization. This variability prevailed over specialization, particularly in cereal production, and is not explained by aspects such as geographical location, form of occupation or monumentality.

There is nothing to indicate that the fortified settlements stored large amounts of surplus and dominated the ditched settlements or vice versa, researchers point out. ""What we observe is that productive diversity and, one would think, the exchange of products, knowledge and people between communities was fundamental in this period of exceptional economic, social and creative development,"" says Selina Delgado-Raak.
Each community would have organized its economy in the most productive way possible, taking into account its surroundings, population size and social conditions. The large ditched settlements had all the tools necessary to carry out the routine work of a community, without specific accumulations of certain materials, such as cereals or arrowheads.
This result is especially relevant in the case of the monumental site of Valencina de la Concepción (Seville), with an extension of more than 250 hectares and multiple ditches. ""The study of more than 150 macrolithic artifacts from the northern part of the site has made it possible to correlate subsistence activities such as milling or stone and fiber-work with habitation structures, confirming that this was a macro settlement occupied by thousands of inhabitants and not a place of worship,"" said Marina Eguíluz.
Cooperative affluent societies 
The strategy of productive diversity detected would be in line with what researchers have called 'cooperative affluent societies' of the late prehistory of Europe and the Middle East. ""These societies were characterized by generating considerable material wealth and at the same time limiting the possibility of exploitation of the labor force and, consequently, the production of surplus value, contrary to what happened later with the Argar society,"" explains Roberto Risch. ""Their organization challenges a unique thought of our times, according to which the production of wealth of any historical era requires the presence of a ruling class or group,"" adds the researcher.
The organization proposed by the researchers does not imply that violence was a foreign element to Chalcolithic Iberia. In fact, the findings at some sites suggest that there was, ""but it was not an omnipresent aspect, a fact that is also confirmed by the anthropological record. Instead of a means to subjugate the population and demand obedience, violence could have been a strategy to achieve the opposite, i.e., to defend a rich society with a high degree of cooperation,"" says Roberto Risch.
In the study, the researchers analysed macrolithic artifacts that Copper Age groups from eighteen sites used for a multitude of tasks, such as grinding cereals, processing food, crushing minerals, cutting stones, waterproofing ceramics, dressing leather, forging and sharpening metal tools and weapons, felling trees and working wood, or butchering animals. ""These are key tools for understanding the economy of a society and how tasks are distributed,"" explain the researchers. The results obtained are in line with other bioarchaeological data (botany, fauna, paleo-nutritional) available for sites of the same period.

In archaeology, this line of research requires an analysis of the technical quality and quantity of the means of production, as well as their spatial distribution and contextualisation. Macrolithic artefacts constituted the means of production in many of the productive processes of past communities, from the Neolithic period to the end of prehistory. This article seeks to utilize macrolithic data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the economic organisation of the Chalcolithic communities in the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula between c. 3100 and 2200 cal BC. These communities produced one of the most outstanding, but at the same time puzzling archaeological records known in later prehistory. The main aim of this exploratory approach, the first of its kind, is to determine if the different forms of occupation of the Chalcolithic, namely monumental, ditched enclosures, fortified and unfortified hill-top settlements, and simple, open settlements were distinguished by specific modes of production. This issue is crucial to the on-going debate about the meaning and relevance of the notion of social complexity in the context of Chalcolithic societies and their political organisation. Our study describes the productive forces of the Chalcolithic settlements as highly variable, both in the type of productive tasks performed and in their intensity, and such variability is not explained by aspects like geographic location, form of occupation, or monumentality. The observed wealth and productive diversity, without signs of marked social hierarchies, emerge as a characteristic feature of what can be defined as cooperative affluent societies."

71 of the 162 ice shelves that surround Antarctica have reduced in volume over 25 years from 1997 to 2021, with a net release of 7.5 trillion tonnes of meltwater into the oceans, say scientists.

They found that almost all the ice shelves on the western side of Antarctica experienced ice loss. In contrast, most of the ice shelves on the eastern side stayed the same or increased in volume.
Over the 25 years, the scientists calculated almost 67 trillion tonnes of ice was exported to the ocean, which was offset by 59 trillion tonnes of ice being added to the ice shelves, giving a net loss of 7.5 trillion tonnes.
Dr Benjamin Davison, a research fellow at the University of Leeds who led the study, said: ""There is a mixed picture of ice-shelf deterioration, and this is to do with the ocean temperature and ocean currents around Antarctica.
""The western half is exposed to warm water, which can rapidly erode the ice shelves from below, whereas much of East Antarctica is currently protected from nearby warm water by a band of cold water at the coast.""
Antarctica is a vast continent -- 50 times the size of the UK -- and the seas on the western side experience different currents and winds than on the east, and this is driving warmer water underneath the ice shelves on the western flank.
Dr Davison, an expert in Earth Observation of polar regions in the School of Earth and Environment, said: ""We expected most ice shelves to go through cycles of rapid, but short-lived shrinking, then to regrow slowly. Instead, we see that almost half of them are shrinking with no sign of recovery.""
He believes human-induced global warming is likely to be a key factor in the loss of the ice. If it was due to natural variation in climate patterns, there would have been some signs of ice regrowth on the western ice shelves.

Ice shelves float on the seas surrounding Antarctica and are extensions to the ice sheet that covers much of the continent. The ice shelves act as giant ""plugs"" at the end of glaciers, slowing down the flow of ice draining into the oceans.
When the ice shelves thin or reduce in size, these plugs weaken with the result that the rate of ice lost from the glaciers increases.
Getz Ice Shelf 
Some of the biggest ice losses were observed on the Getz Ice Shelf, where 1.9 trillion tonnes of ice were lost over the 25-year study period. Just 5 % of that was due to calving, where large chunks of ice breakaway from the shelf and move into the ocean. The rest was due to melting at the base of the ice shelf.
Similarly on the Pine Island Ice Shelf, 1.3 trillion tonnes of ice were lost. Around a third of that loss -- 450 billion tonnes -- was due to calving. The rest due to melting from the underside of the ice shelf.
In contrast, the Amery Ice Shelf -- on the other side of Antarctica -- gained 1.2 trillion tonnes of ice. It is surrounded by much colder waters.

Major assessment of Antarctica 
The researchers analysed over 100,000 satellite radar images to produce this major assessment of the ""state of the health"" of the ice shelves.
If the ice shelves disappear or even diminish, there will be major knock-on effects for the ice system on Antarctica and for global ocean circulation, the giant ""conveyor belt"" which moves nutrients as well as heat and carbon from this sensitive polar ecosystem.
Potential disruption to ocean circulation 
Water released into the ocean from the ice shelves and from the glaciers is freshwater. Over the 25-year study period, the researchers estimated that 66.9 trillion tonnes of freshwater went into the Southern Ocean around Antarctica from the ice shelves alone.
In the Southern Ocean, dense salty water sinks to the ocean floor as part of the global ocean conveyor belt. This sinking of water acts as one of the engines that drive the ocean conveyor belt.
Freshwater from Antarctica dilutes the salty ocean water, making it fresher and lighter, which takes longer to sink and this can weaken the ocean circulation system
A different study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, shows that this process may already be underway.
'Steady attrition' 
Professor Anna Hogg, also from the University of Leeds and a co-author of the study, said: ""The study has generated important findings. We tend to think of ice shelves as going through cyclical advances and retreats. Instead, we are seeing a steady attrition due to melting and calving.
""Many of the ice shelves have deteriorated a lot: 48 lost more than 30% of their initial mass over just 25 years.
""This is further evidence that Antarctica is changing because the climate is warming.
""The study provides a baseline measure from which we can see further changes that may emerge as the climate gets warmer.""
Satellite monitoring 
Information about what is happening in Antarctica in recent years has largely come from the CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites, that can monitor Antarctica even when it is cloudy and through the long polar nights.
CryoSat-2, launched in 2010, was the first European Space Agency Explorer mission and the first dedicated to monitoring the Earth's polar ice sheets and glaciers.
Professor Noel Gourmelen, from the University of Edinburgh and Earthwave and co-author of the study, said: ""CryoSat-2 has been an incredible tool for monitoring the polar environment. Its ability to precisely map the erosion of ice shelves by the ocean below enabled this accurate quantification and partitioning of ice shelf loss, but also revealed fascinating details on how this erosion takes place.""
Details captured by these satellite sensors are so great scientists have been able to track year-by-year changes in Antarctica.
Dr Mark Drinkwater, Head of Earth and Mission Science at the European Space Agency (ESA), said: ""Monitoring and tracking climate change across the vast Antarctic continent requires a satellite system that captures data routinely throughout the year.
""The European Copernicus Programme's Sentinel-1 satellite mission has fulfilled this need. Together with the historical data acquired by its ESA predecessors ERS-1, -2 and Envisat, Sentinel-1 has revolutionised our ability to take stock of floating ice shelves, as a bellwether for mass balance and the health of the Antarctic ice sheet.

Of the shelves that lost mass, 68 had statistically significant negative mass trends, 48 lost more than 30% of their initial mass, and basal melting was the dominant contributor to that mass loss at a majority (68%). At many ice shelves, mass losses due to basal melting or iceberg calving were significantly positively correlated with grounding line discharge anomalies; however, the strength and form of this relationship varied substantially between ice shelves. Our results illustrate the utility of partitioning high-resolution ice shelf mass balance observations into its components to quantify the contributors to ice shelf mass change and the response of grounded ice."

As the climate warms, there is major concern that Earth's ocean will lose oxygen. A study published recently by oceanographers at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa revealed that locked in ancient deep-sea sediments is evidence for oxygen loss in the world's ocean during past glacial periods, indicating that widespread oxygen loss with current climate change may not be permanent.

Scientists first measured oxygen in the oceans in the 1960s. Since then, they have observed decreasing levels in the mid-depths of the ocean -- a phenomenon that can be explained in part by the fact that warmer waters hold less oxygen. Less oxygen in the water can lead to habitat loss for fish and other marine species that need oxygen to breathe. If the naturally-occurring low-oxygen regions in the Eastern Pacific expand in a warmer climate, Pacific Island fisheries could be significantly impacted.
Cobalt holds the clues in deep-sea sediments
""Ultimately, it would be helpful if we knew how low-oxygen regions of the ocean changed with past climate changes,"" said Nick Hawco, lead author of the study and assistant professor of oceanography, in the UH Manoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST). ""However, the problem is that oxygen is a gas, so we don't have any reservoirs of past oceans to test the oxygen content. Our new study builds off of prior work where we discovered that low oxygen water bodies in the Pacific are enriched in the metal cobalt.""
""One of the biggest sources of cobalt to the oceans is where oxygen deficient zones intersect with the continental shelf, leach cobalt from the shelf, and then transport it across the ocean in a plume of low oxygen water,"" said Rhea Foreman, study co-author and oceanography researcher in SOEST. ""The cobalt is subsequently incorporated into minerals that are deposited onto the seafloor and preserved in the sedimentary record.""
The researchers analyzed seafloor sediments from the past 145,000 years, a timeframe that includes the last major ice age. They found more cobalt in sediments from the past ice ages, compared to more recent sediments.
""This means that there was a build up of cobalt in the Pacific during the last ice age,"" said Hawco. ""Because high cobalt is a proxy, or a stand-in, for low oxygen, this indicates there were probably larger regions of low oxygen waters in the Pacific during that time.""
Time to adapt

One suggested explanation for low-oxygen waters being more common in cold climates is the change in ocean circulation that accompanies climate change. Today, complex currents flowing from west to east help add oxygen to the mid-depth waters of the tropical Pacific.
""If these currents weaken, the oxygen in the Pacific would decline,"" said Hawco. ""This is what we think happened during the last glacial period. But we don't know how strongly -- or how fast -- these currents will respond to ocean warming.""
This could mean that fish and other species are able to adapt to changing oxygen as long as these changes are slow enough, as appears to have happened in the past.
""We need to reduce emissions as soon as possible to buy time for these ecosystems to adapt to the climate change we are already locked into based on the last 150 years of carbon emissions,"" added Hawco.

DNA analysis of mummified feces reveals two pre-Columbian Caribbean cultures ate a wide variety of plants, like maize, sweet potato, and peanuts -- and tobacco and cotton traces were detected too, according to a study published October 11, 2023 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Jelissa Reynoso-García from the University of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico, and colleagues.

Mummified feces, or coprolites, can reveal clues to diet and lifestyle. In this study, Reynoso-García and colleagues analyzed plant DNA isolated from coprolites sampled from archeological sites of two pre-Columbian cultures (Huecoid and Saladoid) to see what these peoples ate and drank.
The authors carefully extracted and analyzed plant DNA from ten coprolite samples at the La Hueca archaeological site in Puerto Rico. They compared the extracted plant DNA against a database of diverse coprolite samples and contemporary plant DNA sequences.
The results suggest that Huecoid and Saladoid people enjoyed a diverse and sophisticated food system, with sweet potato, wild and domesticated peanut, chili peppers, a domesticated strain of tomatoes, papaya and maize all detected. The analysis also detected tobacco, possibly due to the use of chewing tobacco, pulverized tobacco inhalation, or tobacco as a food additive for medicinal and/or hallucinogenic purposes. Also surprisingly, cotton was detected -- perhaps due to the use of ground cotton seeds for oil, or because women wet the cotton strands with their saliva leaving strands in the mouth while weaving. The authors did not find evidence of cassava/manioc/yucca (Manihot esculenta) consumption, though this plant was often reported as a staple food in the pre-Columbian Caribbean by chroniclers. The authors note that the elaborate grating and drying cassava preparation techniques reported in these accounts might have degraded the plant DNA, or that this might have been a seasonal staple food.
Due to food preparation techniques, the fact that each coprolite sample is only a snapshot of what one specific person had been recently eating, and the limitation that the authors were only able to identify plants also in current DNA sequence databases (not capturing any now-extinct, rare, or non-commercial crops) it's likely that the Huecoid and Saladoid people ate other plants or fungi not noted here. Nevertheless, the authors hope this analysis gives further insight into the lives of pre-Columbian people of the Americas.
Dr. Toranzos adds: ""Who would have thought that something that we avoid even looking at would contain so much information? It's especially incredible that this is so even after thousands of years.""

We also analyzed DNA sequences of putative phytopathogenic fungi, likely ingested during food consumption, to further support dietary habits. Our findings show that pre-Columbian Caribbean cultures had a diverse diet consisting of maize (Zea mays), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), chili peppers (Capsicum annuum), peanuts (Arachis spp.), papaya (Carica papaya), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and, very surprisingly cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris). Modelling of putative phytopathogenic fungi and plant interactions confirmed the potential consumption of these plants as well as edible fungi, particularly Ustilago spp., which suggest the consumption of maize and huitlacoche. These findings suggest that a variety of dietary, medicinal, and hallucinogenic plants likely played an important role in ancient human subsistence and societal customs. We compared our results with coprolites found in Mexico and the United States, as well as present-day faeces from Mexico, Peru, and the United States. The results suggest that the diet of pre-Columbian cultures resembled that of present-day hunter-gatherers, while agriculturalists exhibited a transitional state in dietary lifestyles between the pre-Columbian cultures and larger scale farmers and United States individuals. Our study highlights differences in dietary patterns related to human lifestyles and provides insight into the flora present in the pre-Columbian Caribbean area. Importantly, data from ancient fecal specimens demonstrate the importance of ancient DNA studies to better understand pre-Columbian populations."

Evolutionary biologists have for the first time decoded the genetic lineage of a famous killer whale and a pod that once worked alongside whale hunters off the coast of New South Wales.

In the Australian tradition of claiming New Zealand's celebrities as its own, Old Tom, the leader of a pod of killer whales that famously helped whalers hunt baleen whales in the 20th century, has ancestral links to modern-day killer whales in New Zealand, according to new DNA research.
Old Tom also shared a common ancestor with killer whales from Australasia, the North Pacific, and North Atlantic Oceans, but is most similar to modern New Zealand killer whales. However, most of Tom's DNA code is not found in other killer whales globally suggesting that the killer whales of Eden may have become extinct locally.
Known as the killers of Eden, Old Tom, and his family would help whalers hunt their target and were rewarded with the lips and tongues from the whale carcass. This is known as the ""Law of the Tongue.""
This legendary relationship between the whalers and Old Tom's family persisted and developed a strong bond across many generations of whalers. Measuring 6.7 metres in length and weighing six tonnes, Old Tom is now on display in the Eden Killer Whale Museum after washing up on shore in 1930.
Led by PhD Candidate Isabella Reeves at Flinders University and the Cetacean Research Centre, alongside a global research team that undertook an ambitious journey relying on ancient DNA techniques to attempt to trace Old Tom's genetic lineage through DNA sequencing and comparing his DNA with killer whales globally.
Through collaboration with Thaua Traditional Custodian Steven Holmes, the researchers have also revealed new insights in an attempt to decolonise the history of the Killers of Eden never officially documented before.

Lead researcher Isabella Reeves says that while the genetic comparisons didn't find any direct descendants of Old Tom, the researchers did find that Tom shared much of his DNA variation with other killer whales, suggesting they are locally extinct today.
""The killers of Eden represent a rare partnership between people and whales. It was an exciting journey to trace the genetic ancestry of Old Tom, in order to provide the first insights into the genetic history of this group that captured the hearts of the community and whale lovers.""
""Our research also delved into uncharted territory by unveiling a decolonised history. We collaborated with a Traditional Custodian, which gave us a fresh perspective on Eden's whaling history to rectify historical inaccuracies and shed light on a crucial aspect of this unique story about the bond between their people and these whales. Importantly, we want to ensure this aspect of the story is acknowledged moving forward.""
In Twofold Bay, the coastal Thaua people, part of the Yuin nation, had a connection with the killer whales through the Dreaming, a relationship that was highly respected and relied upon due to the Thaua's dependency on the ocean for resources.
""It's important that we recognise that Indigenous Australians initiated the relationship with the killer whales before European colonisation and the advent of commercial whaling locally. This study rectifies discrepancies in local records and provides new insight into the origins of the killer whales in Eden and the history of Australasian killer whales,"" says Ms Reeves.
Traditional Custodian, Steven Holmes, says the Thaua people had a long-lasting friendship with the whales in Eden, especially Old Tom.
""We consider beowas (killer whales) to be our brothers. Our Dreamtime stories which connect us to the beowas, is that when a Thaua member dies, they are reincarnated as a beowa. The beowas remained part of the Thaua, even after passing. The beowas would help the men by herding the other whales in the bay of Turembulerrer (Twofold Bay) for the whalers to kill. The Indigenous whalers would reward the beowas the tongue of the dead whale. This was soon known as the Law of the Tongue.""

How these killer whales from Eden relate to other populations globally and whether their genetic descendants persist today remains unknown. We extracted and sequenced DNA from Old Tom using ancient DNA techniques. Genomic sequences were then compared with a global dataset of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Old Tom shared a most recent common ancestor with killer whales from Australasia, the North Atlantic, and the North Pacific, having the highest genetic similarity with contemporary New Zealand killer whales. However, much of the variation found in Old Tom’s genome was not shared with these widespread populations, suggesting ancestral rather than ongoing gene flow. Our genetic comparisons also failed to find any clear descendants of Tom, raising the possibility of local extinction of this group. We integrated Traditional Custodian knowledge to recapture the events in Eden and recognize that Indigenous Australians initiated the relationship with the killer whales before European colonization and the advent of commercial whaling locally.

People who carry three gene variants that have been inherited from Neanderthals are more sensitive to some types of pain, according to a new study co-led by UCL researchers.

The findings, published in Communications Biology, are the latest findings to show how past interbreeding with Neanderthals has influenced the genetics of modern humans.
The researchers found that people carrying three so-called Neanderthal variants in the gene SCN9A, which is implicated in sensory neurons, are more sensitive to pain from skin pricking after prior exposure to mustard oil.
Previous research has identified three variations in the SCN9A gene -- known as M932L, V991L, and D1908G -- in sequenced Neanderthal genomes and reports of greater pain sensitivity among humans carrying all three variants. However, prior to this study the specific sensory responses affected by these variants was unclear.
An international team led by researchers at UCL, Aix-Marseille University, University of Toulouse, Open University, Fudan University, and Oxford University, and part-funded by Wellcome, measured the pain thresholds of 1,963 people from Colombia in response to a range of stimuli.
The SCN9A gene encodes a sodium channel that is expressed at high levels in sensory neurons that detect signals from damaged tissue. The researchers found that the D1908G variant of the gene was present in around 20% of chromosomes within this population and around 30% of chromosomes carrying this variant also carried the M932L and V991L variants.
The authors found that the three variants were associated with a lower pain threshold in response to skin pricking after prior exposure to mustard oil, but not in response to heat or pressure. Additionally, carrying all three variants was associated with greater pain sensitivity than carrying only one.

When they analysed the genomic region including SCN9A using genetic data from 5,971 people from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, the authors found that the three Neanderthal variants were more common in populations with higher proportions of Native American ancestry, such as the Peruvian population, in which the average proportion of Native American ancestry was 66%.
The authors propose that the Neanderthal variants may sensitise sensory neurons by altering the threshold at which a nerve impulse is generated. They speculate that the variants may be more common in populations with higher proportions of Native American ancestry as a result of random chance and population bottlenecks that occurred during the initial occupation of the Americas. Although acute pain can moderate behaviour and prevent further injury, the scientists that say additional research is needed to determine whether carrying these variants and having greater pain sensitivity may have been advantageous during human evolution.
Previous research by co-corresponding author Dr Kaustubh Adhikari (UCL Genetics, Evolution & Environment and The Open University) has shown that humans also inherited some genetic material from Neanderthals affecting the shape of our noses.*
Dr Adhikari commented: ""In the last 15 years, since the Neanderthal genome was first sequenced, we have been learning more and more about what we have inherited from them as a result of interbreeding tens of thousands of years ago.
""Pain sensitivity is an important survival trait that enables us to avoid painful things that could cause us serious harm. Our findings suggest that Neanderthals may have been more sensitive to certain types of pain, but further research is needed for us to understand why that is the case, and whether these specific genetic variants were evolutionarily advantageous.""
First author Dr Pierre Faux (Aix-Marseille University and University of Toulouse) said: ""We have shown how variation in our genetic code can alter how we perceive pain, including genes that modern humans acquired from the Neanderthals. But genes are just one of many factors, including environment, past experience, and psychological factors, which influence pain.""

Three functional variants in the SCN9A gene (encoding M932L, V991L, and D1908G in Nav1.7), have recently been identified as stemming from Neanderthal introgression and to associate with pain symptomatology in UK BioBank data. In 1000 genomes data, these variants are absent in Europeans but common in Latin Americans. Analysing high-density genotype data from 7594 Latin Americans, we characterized Neanderthal introgression in SCN9A. We find that tracts of introgression occur on a Native American genomic background, have an average length of ~123 kb and overlap the M932L, V991L, and D1908G coding positions. Furthermore, we measured experimentally six pain thresholds in 1623 healthy Colombians. We found that Neanderthal ancestry in SCN9A is significantly associated with a lower mechanical pain threshold after sensitization with mustard oil and evidence of additivity of effects across Nav1.7 variants. Our findings support the reported association of Neanderthal Nav1.7 variants with clinical pain, define a specific sensory modality affected by archaic introgression in SCN9A and are consistent with independent effects of the Neanderthal variants on Nav1.7 function."

In September 2023, extreme rains struck South Africa's Western Cape province, flooding villages and leaving a trail of destruction. The catastrophic devastation is just one recent example in a string of extreme weather events that are growing more common around the world. Fueled by rising sea surface temperatures from global warming, torrential storms are increasing both in frequency and magnitude. Concurrently, global warming is also producing the opposite effect in other instances, as a mega-drought recently threatened the water supply of Cape Town in southwestern Africa to the point where residents were at risk of running out of water. This one-two punch of weather extremes are devastating habitats, ecosystems and human infrastructure.

With global warming apparently here to stay, a team of paleoclimatologists from Syracuse University, George Mason University and the University of Connecticut are studying an ancient source to determine future rainfall and drought patterns: fossilized plants that lived on Earth millions of years ago.
In a study led by Claire Rubbelke, a Ph.D. candidate in Earth and Environmental Sciences in Syracuse University's College of Arts and Sciences (A&S), and Tripti Bhattacharya, Thonis Family Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences in A&S, researchers zeroed in on the Pliocene epoch (~3 million years ago) -- a time when conditions were very similar to today. Despite warmer temperatures, many parts of the world, including southwestern Africa, experienced dramatic increases in rainfall over land, likely caused by warmer than normal sea surface temperatures. This mimics a modern event called a Benguela Niño, where researchers believe shifting winds cause warm waters to move southward along the coast of Africa causing enhanced rainfall over typically arid regions.
""In the present day, the intensity and location of extreme precipitation from Benguela Niño events appear to be influenced by both Atlantic and Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures,"" says Rubbelke, who is a member of Bhattacharya's Paleoclimate Dynamics Lab. ""During the Pliocene, it appears that these Benguela Niño-like conditions may have been a permanent feature.""
The team's work was inspired by collaborator and study co-author Natalie Burls, associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Earth Sciences at George Mason University. Burls, an oceanographer and climate scientist from South Africa who received a Ph.D. at the University of Cape Town, has long been intrigued by the way geological evidence from past warm climates in Earth's history can help researchers make sense of future rainfall and drought conditions.
""This study, which explored how past warm climates can inform us on what to expect in the future as our planet warms, brings to the fore the important role of ocean warming patterns,"" says Burls. ""It's important to understand how these patterns determine the response of the hydrological cycle over southwest Africa to global warming.""
To study the impact of global warming on precipitation from millions of years in the past, the team analyzed 'molecular fossils' in the form of ancient leaf waxes. ""These are compounds produced by leaves to protect themselves from drying out,"" says Bhattacharya. ""They get shed from leaf surfaces and find their way to ocean sediments, where we can extract them and study their chemical composition.""
Plants use hydrogen from rainwater to produce the waxy outer coating on their leaves, which survives in ocean sediment for millions of years. The leaf wax functions as a time capsule preserved in ocean sediment.

After transporting the millions-year-old sediment from Africa to their lab in Syracuse, Rubbelke and Bhattacharya used heat and pressure to extract lipids (e.g. fat molecules), and then used a variety of solvents to isolate the exact class of molecules that they were looking to measure. From those molecules, they determined the number of different types of hydrogen present.
Researchers dilute sediment cores with a variety of solvents. The samples are forced through a column of silica gel, which traps the unwanted chemicals and leaves the alkanes they want to measure. The dark line at the bottom of the liquid in the middle three columns is where some extra chemicals are getting stuck, while other chemicals can traverse through the gel to drip into vials at the bottom.
""When we measure the amount of heavy and light isotopes of hydrogen in the waxes, it reveals different physical processes like increased rainfall, or how far the water vapor travels,"" says Rubbelke. ""We can therefore identify changes in these processes by looking at long-term changes of hydrogen.""
By comparing their data to climate models, they verify how well those models capture past climate change, which can in turn improve the accuracy of those models to predict future rainfall. As Bhattacharya notes, this is critical because climate models often disagree on whether certain regions will get wetter or drier in response to global warming.
""We are using real world data from the ancient geologic past to improve our ability to model rainfall changes as the planet warms,"" she says.
The study's third author, Ran Feng, assistant professor of Earth sciences at the University of Connecticut, helped analyze the comparison data and specifically examined the proposed mechanism that explains the Pliocene wet conditions in southwest Africa. She says many features of ongoing climate change are reincarnations of the past warm climates.

""In our case, we have shown that sea surface temperature pattern surrounding South Africa is key to explaining the past hydroclimate conditions of this region,"" notes Feng. ""Looking into the future, how this sea surface temperature pattern may evolve has profound implications to the environmental changes in South Africa.""
Rubbelke, whose interest in paleoclimate research started in high school while studying ice cores and oxygen isotopes, says that the work she is doing alongside Bhattacharya at Syracuse is particularly fulfilling because they are contributing valuable data to an area where there is currently a knowledge gap.
""This research is really cool because not a lot of paleoclimate records from the Southern Hemisphere exist, compared to the Northern Hemisphere at least,"" says Rubbelke. ""I feel like I'm really contributing to an international research effort to rectify that.""
As to whether the future will be wetter or drier in southwestern Africa, the team's results suggests that both are possible, depending on where extreme sea surface temperatures are occurring.
While not much can be done to reverse global warming, short of cutting the use of fossil fuels completely, the researchers say this study illuminates the need for vulnerable communities to have the tools and resources to adapt to these seemingly more frequent extreme weather events.
""A key aspect of helping vulnerable communities involves improving our ability to predict hydroclimate extremes, ""says Bhattacharya. ""Our study directly speaks to this need, as we show that sea surface temperature patterns strongly influence climate models' ability to predict changes in rainfall in southwestern Africa.""
Bhattacharya and Rubbelke's research on this project was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation: OCE-1903148, OCE-2103015 and EAR-2018078.

However, insights from past warm climates, like the Pliocene, can reveal mechanisms of future change and help benchmark models. Using leaf wax hydrogen isotopes to reconstruct precipitation (δDp) from Namibia over the past 5 million years, we find a long‐term depletion trend (−50‰). Empirical mode decomposition indicates this trend is linked to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) within the Benguela Upwelling System, but modulated by Indian Ocean SSTs on shorter timescales. The influence of SSTs on reconstructed regional hydroclimate is similar to that observed during modern Benguela Nio events, which bring extreme flooding to the region. Isotope‐enabled simulations and PlioMIP2 results suggest that capturing a Benguela Nio‐like state is key to accurately simulating Pliocene, and future, regional hydroclimate. This has implications for future regional climate, since an increased frequency of Benguela Nios poses risk to the ecosystems and industries in the region."

The hunt for the world's most ancient mammals descended into academic warfare in the seventies, researchers from the University of Bristol have discovered.

In a study published today in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, Professor Mike Benton University of Bristol's School of Earth Sciences and Dr David Whiteside and Dr Pam Gill also of the School of Earth Sciences and Scientific Associates of the Natural History Museum suggest Professors from Cambridge and London Universities accused each other of bad behaviour as a dispute broke out over fossil rights.
Professor Rex Parrington from Cambridge University and Professor Kenneth Kermack from University College, London (UCL) were studying the world's oldest mammals, from the Triassic and Jurassic of south Wales, from rocks in caves and fissures about 200 million years old. However relations soured after Professor Parrington's team seemingly took four tons of clay rich in fossils that Professor Kermack had collected from quarries in South Wales.
The fossils were tiny teeth, jaws, and other bones from shrew-sized little animals that were the distant ancestors of humans, cats, and dogs. These fossils were hugely important for understanding how mammals originated, and especially the timing of all their special features such as warm-bloodedness, large brains, specialized teeth, parental care and milk.
""We spoke to Cambridge students of the time,"" said Professor Benton, lead author of the paper. ""They reported that this pile of sediment was their main work for a long time. The students processed the clay in different chemicals to break it down and picked out teeth and jaw bones under the microscope. They got some excellent specimens, which Parrington was able to study.
""Kermack was furious and made his views clear that Parrington had stolen his rocks.
""Parrington meanwhile said that the pile of mud had been left to rot and should be available for study and he had done the right thing in sharing it with his students.""
Dr Whiteside explained: ""We spoke to other students from Cambridge and UCL at the time, and they helped us to piece together what had happened and why the dispute rumbled on.

""It seems that Kermack had been collecting his specimens from quarries in south Wales, and he used to bring back tons of sediment to be processed and the tiny teeth were picked out.
""He had apparently left a pile of four tons of clay with fossils at one of the quarries, and Parrington's team came down with a truck in 1966 and took most of it back to Cambridge.""
""I was a PhD student with Professor Kermack in the 1970s,"" said Pam Gill. ""I knew that relations were strained between my supervisor and Professor Parrington, but, by working on the fossil mammals in both their collections, I rather naïvely got caught in the cross-fire.
""This all matters because these locations in south Wales were nearly the only source of such ancient mammal fossils anywhere in the world, and palaeontologists around the world were waiting for the latest reports from Kermack or Parrington to understand these rather limited but rare clues about the earliest mammals.
""Now we have amazing fossils from China, Brazil, and other parts of the world, and it's hard to realise just how important those British fossils were at that time.""
The first finds had been made about 1850 near Bristol and since then the fossils usually piled up very slowly. However, a German palaeontologist Walter G Kühne, a brilliant fossil finder, discovered many new fossil localities in the 1940s and 1950s and these provided the great horde of fossils which was the basis of the dispute between Kermack and Parrington.
""Digging into this history has been fascinating,"" concluded Professor Benton. ""We had lived through the tail-end of the time of squabbles, and wanted to get the truth from both sides before it was all forgotten. We had no idea we would unearth such amazing stories, and that they are all true!""

This rich documentation of the oldest mammals has made them especially important for mammalian palaeobiology on a global scale. The first specimens were found in the 1860s, and collection and study has been sporadic, with especially fruitful times in the 1860s, and then from 1938–1979.

New analysis of the remains of victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, contradicts the widespread belief the flu disproportionately impacted healthy young adults.

Because so many people fell ill so quickly, physicians at the time believed the healthy were as likely to die from the flu as those who had already been sick or frail. Despite numerous historical accounts, though, it turns out there is no concrete scientific evidence to support that belief.
Researchers at McMaster University and the University of Colorado Boulder who analyzed victims' age of death and studied lesions on victims' bones report that the most susceptible to dying of the flu had exhibited signs of previous environmental, social and nutritional stress.
""Our circumstances -- social, cultural and immunological -- are all intertwined and have always shaped the life and death of people, even in the distant past,"" explains Amanda Wissler, an assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at McMaster and lead author on the study, published today in the journal PNAS.
""We saw this during COVID-19, where our social backgrounds and our cultural backgrounds influenced who was more likely to die, and who was likely to survive,"" she says.
Much of the research on the 1918 pandemic relies on historical documentation such as vital statistics, census data and life insurance records, none of which include information on pre-existing conditions, or general environmental, dietary or other chronic stressors which can impact one's overall health over the course of a lifetime.
For the study, researchers examined the skeletal remains of 369 individuals from the Hamman-Todd Documented skeletal collection, which is housed at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. All had died between 1910 and 1938. The sample was divided into two groups: a control group who had died before the pandemic, and those who died during the pandemic.

A living person's skeletal structure may undergo lasting changes due to poor health, resulting in diminished height, irregular growth, developmental tooth defects and other indicators.
The team searched for lesions, or indicators of stress, on the shinbones of the pandemic victims. New bone formation occurs in response to inflammation caused by physical trauma or infection, for example. Researchers can determine if a lesion had been active, in the midst of healing or had completely healed, all of which provide evidence of underlying conditions.
""By comparing who had lesions, and whether these lesions were active or healing at the time of death, we get a picture of what we call frailty, or who is more likely to die. Our study shows that people with these active lesions are the most frail,"" says Sharon DeWitte, a biological anthropologist at the University Colorado Boulder and co-author on the study.
Preexisting medical conditions such as asthma or congestive heart failure are common risk factors which can contribute to poor outcomes from infectious diseases such as influenza.
Racism and institutional discrimination can amplify these effects, as evidenced in the COVID-19 pandemic, say researchers. During the Black Death in London, for example, individuals who had previously suffered environmental, nutritional and disease stressors were more likely to die from the plague than their healthier peers.
""The results of our work counter the narrative and the anecdotal accounts of the time,"" says Wissler. ""This paints a very complicated picture of life and death during the 1918 pandemic.""
The researchers plan to continue to explore the relationship between socioeconomic status and mortality in future work.

Contemporary accounts further describe the victims as healthy young adults, which is contrary to the understanding of selective mortality, which posits that individuals with the highest frailty within a group are at the greatest risk of death. We use a bioarchaeological approach, combining individual-level information on health and stress gleaned from the skeletal remains of individuals who died in 1918 to determine whether healthy individuals were dying during the 1918 pandemic or whether underlying frailty contributed to an increased risk of mortality. Skeletal data on tibial periosteal new bone formation were obtained from 369 individuals from the Hamann–Todd documented osteological collection in Cleveland, Ohio. Skeletal data were analyzed alongside known age at death using Kaplan–Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards analysis. The results suggest that frail or unhealthy individuals were more likely to die during the pandemic than those who were not frail. During the flu, the estimated hazards for individuals with periosteal lesions that were active at the time of death were over two times higher compared to the control group. The results contradict prior assumptions about selective mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic. Even among young adults, not everyone was equally likely to die—those with evidence of systemic stress suffered greater mortality. These findings provide time depth to our understanding of how variation in life experiences can impact morbidity and mortality even during a pandemic caused by a novel pathogen."

An international team of scientists have discovered a huge spike in radiocarbon levels 14,300 years ago by analysing ancient tree-rings found in the French Alps.  

The radiocarbon spike was caused by a massive solar storm, the biggest ever identified. 
A similar solar storm today would be catastrophic for modern technological society -- potentially wiping out telecommunications and satellite systems, causing massive electricity grid blackouts, and costing us billions of pounds. 
The academics are warning of the importance of understanding such storms to protect our global communications and energy infrastructure for the future.         
The collaborative research, which was carried out by an international team of scientists, is published today (Oct 9) in The Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences and reveals new insights into the Sun's extreme behaviour and the risks it poses to Earth.  
A team of researchers from the Collège de France, CEREGE, IMBE, Aix-Marseille University and the University of Leeds measured radiocarbon levels in ancient trees preserved within the eroded banks of the Drouzet River, near Gap, in the Southern French Alps.   
The tree trunks, which are subfossils -- remains whose fossilization process is not complete -- were sliced into tiny single tree-rings. Analysis of these individual rings identified an unprecedented spike in radiocarbon levels occurring precisely 14,300 years ago. By comparing this radiocarbon spike with measurements of beryllium, a chemical element found in Greenland ice cores, the team proposes that the spike was caused by a massive solar storm that would have ejected huge volumes of energetic particles into Earth's atmosphere. 
Edouard Bard, Professor of Climate and Ocean Evolution at the Collège de France and CEREGE, and lead author of the study, said: ""Radiocarbon is constantly being produced in the upper atmosphere through a chain of reactions initiated by cosmic rays. Recently, scientists have found that extreme solar events including solar flares and coronal mass ejections can also create short-term bursts of energetic particles which are preserved as huge spikes in radiocarbon production occurring over the course of just a single year."" 

Potentially catastrophic
The researchers say that the occurrence of similar massive solar storms today could be catastrophic for modern technological society, potentially wiping out telecommunications, satellite systems and electricity grids - and costing us billions of pounds. They warn that it is critical to understand the future risks of events like this, to enable us to prepare, build resilience into our communications and energy systems and shield them from potential damage. 
Tim Heaton, Professor of Applied Statistics in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds, said: ""Extreme solar storms could have huge impacts on Earth. Such super storms could permanently damage the transformers in our electricity grids, resulting in huge and widespread blackouts lasting months. They could also result in permanent damage to the satellites that we all rely on for navigation and telecommunication, leaving them unusable. They would also create severe radiation risks to astronauts.""    
Miyake Events
Nine such extreme solar storms -- known as Miyake Events -- have now been identified as having occurred over the last 15,000 years. The most recent confirmed Miyake Events occurred in 993 AD and 774 AD. This newly-identified 14,300-year-old storm is, however, the largest that has ever been found -- roughly twice the size of these two. 
The exact nature of these Miyake Events remains very poorly understood as they have never been directly observed instrumentally. They highlight that we still have much to learn about the behaviour of the Sun and the dangers it poses to society on Earth. We do not know what causes such extreme solar storms to occur, how frequently they might occur, or if we can somehow predict them.  
Professor Bard said: ""Direct instrumental measurements of solar activity only began in the 17th century with the counting of sunspots. Nowadays, we also obtain detailed records using ground-based observatories, space probes, and satellites. However, all these short-term instrumental records are insufficient for a complete understanding of the Sun. Radiocarbon measured in tree-rings, used alongside beryllium in polar ice cores, provide the best way to understand the Sun's behaviour further back into the past."" 

The largest, directly-observed, solar storm occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event. It caused massive disruption on Earth -- destroying telegraph machines and creating a night-time aurora so bright that birds began to sing, believing the Sun had begun to rise. However, the Miyake Events (including the newly discovered 14,300-yr-old storm) would have been a staggering entire order-of-magnitude greater in size. 
Professor Heaton said: ""Radiocarbon provides a phenomenal way of studying Earth's history and reconstructing critical events that it has experienced. A precise understanding of our past is essential if we want to accurately predict our future and mitigate potential risks. We still have much to learn. Each new discovery not only helps answer existing key questions but can also generate new ones."" 
Cécile Miramont, Associate Professor of Paleoenvironments and Paleoclimates at IMBE, Aix-en-Provence University, said: ""Finding such a collection of preserved trees was truly exceptional. By comparing the widths of the individual tree rings in the multiple tree trunks, we then carefully pieced together the separate trees to create a longer timeline using a method called dendrochronology. This allowed us to discover invaluable information on past environmental changes and measure radiocarbon over an uncharted period of solar activity.""

Charles Darwin said that evolution was constantly happening, causing animals to adapt for survival. But many of his contemporaries disagreed. If evolution is always causing things to change, they asked, then how is it that two fossils from the same species, found in the same location, can look identical despite being 50 million years apart in age?

Everything changed in the past 40 years, when an explosion of evolutionary studies proved that evolution can and does occur rapidly -- even from one generation to the next. Evolutionary biologists were thrilled, but the findings reinforced the same paradox: If evolution can happen so fast, then why do most species on Earth continue to appear the same for many millions of years?
This is known as the paradox of stasis, and James Stroud, assistant professor in the School of Biological Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, set out to investigate it. He conducted a long-term study in a community of lizards, measuring how evolution unfolds in the wild across multiple species. In doing so, he may have found the answer to one of evolution's greatest challenges.
His research was published as the cover story in the Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences.
""We call this a paradox because it doesn't seem to make any sense,"" Stroud said. ""The most common explanation is that natural selection is working to stabilize a species' appearance, with the assumption that an average form will help them survive the best. The problem is, when people do field studies, they almost never find that this kind of 'stabilizing' selection actually exists.""
Lassoing Lizards
Stroud set up a field study with four different species of Anolis lizards (anoles) on a small island at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Gardens in Coral Gables, Florida. He measured natural selection in all four lizard species over five consecutive time periods by catching and monitoring the survival of every lizard on the island.

Stroud and his colleagues searched day and night for lizards. Using long fishing poles with tiny lassos at their tips, they gently captured them by their strong necks, placed them in coolers, and documented the exact branch or stump where they found each lizard.
Back in the lab, Stroud measured the lizards' heads, legs, feet, weight, and even the stickiness of their toes. After assigning an identifying number to each lizard and marking them with a tiny tag under the skin, the team released the lizards to the same branches where they'd found them. They went out in the following days and weeks to catch the rest of them.
Every six months for three years, Stroud and his team started the process over again. Catching the same lizards, taking measurements, releasing them, and making notes of which lizards survived and which didn't.
A Picture of Evolution Is Worth a Thousand Lizards
By incorporating data for each time period, Stroud captured the history of every lizard in the community. He then related survival data to the variation in body traits, which allowed him to analyze which body traits were important predictors of survival. Taken together, the analysis painted a picture of how natural selection operated on the community as a whole.
To his surprise, Stroud found that the stabilizing form of natural selection -- that which maintains a species' same, average features -- was extremely rare. In fact, natural selection varied massively through time. Some years, lizards with longer legs would survive better, and other years, lizards with shorter legs fared better. For other times, there was no clear pattern at all.

""The most fascinating result is that natural selection was extremely variable through time,"" Stroud said. ""We often saw that selection would completely flip in direction from one year to the next. When combined into a long-term pattern, however, all this variation effectively canceled itself out: Species remained remarkably similar across the entire time period.""
The findings provided by Stroud's study had never been seen before. There had never been such insight into how selection works on a community level, and certainly not at this level of detail.
The reason scientists never understood how evolution works on the community level is because long-term studies like Stroud's are extremely rare. Researchers are unlikely to undertake such projects because of the great amount of work and time required.
""Evolution can and does happen -- it's this ongoing process, but it doesn't necessarily mean things are constantly changing in the long run,"" Stroud said. ""Now we know that even if animals appear to be staying the same, evolution is still happening.""
According to Stroud, understanding evolution is critical to everything that we want to understand about life on Earth.
""Understanding evolution doesn't only help us understand the plants and animals around us and how they're distributed across the world,"" he said. ""It also shows us how life sustains itself in a world dominated by humans.""
There have been very few studies that monitor how evolution unfolds in the wild at long time scales. That, according to Stroud, is why we have a biased view of what evolution is.
""For a very long time, evolutionary biologists have tried to figure out what was behind this paradox of stasis idea,"" Stroud said. ""What this study shows is that the answer may not be particularly complicated -- we just had to conduct a study in the wild for a long enough time to figure it out.""

Stabilizing selection—in which fitness is highest for intermediate phenotypes and lowest for the extremes—has been widely invoked as responsible for this pattern. At the community level, such stabilizing selection acting individually on co-occurring species is expected to produce a rugged fitness landscape on which different species occupy distinct fitness peaks. However, even with an explosion of microevolutionary field studies over the past four decades, evidence for persistent stabilizing selection driving long-term stasis is lacking. Nonetheless, biologists continue to invoke stabilizing selection as a major factor explaining macroevolutionary patterns. Here, by directly measuring natural selection in the wild, we identified a complex community-wide fitness surface in which fourAnolislizard species each occupy a distinct fitness peak close to their mean phenotype. The presence of local fitness optima within species, and fitness valleys between species, presents a barrier to adaptive evolutionary change and acts to maintain species differences through time. However, instead of continuously operating stabilizing selection, we found that species were maintained on these peaks by the combination of many independent periods among which selection fluctuated in form, strength, direction, or existence and in which stabilizing selection rarely occurred. Our results suggest that lack of substantial phenotypic evolutionary change through time may be the result of selection, but not persistent stabilizing selection as classically envisioned."

According to a new paper, ancient Maya reservoirs, which used aquatic plants to filter and clean the water, ""can serve as archetypes for natural, sustainable water systems to address future water needs.""

The Maya built and maintained reservoirs that were in use for more than 1,000 years, wrote University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign anthropology professor Lisa Lucero in a perspective in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. These reservoirs provided potable water for thousands to tens of thousands of people in cities during the annual, five-month dry season and in periods of prolonged drought.
""Most major southern lowland Maya cities emerged in areas that lacked surface water but had great agricultural soils,"" Lucero said. ""They compensated by constructing reservoir systems that started small and grew in size and complexity.""
Over time, the Maya built canals, dams, sluices and berms to direct, store and transport water. They used quartz sand for water filtration, sometimes importing it from great distances to massive cities like Tikal in what is now northern Guatemala. A sediment core from one of Tikal's reservoirs also found that zeolite sand had been used in its construction. Previous studies have shown that this volcanic sand can filter impurities and disease-causing microbes from water. The zeolite also would have been imported from sources about 18 miles (30 kilometers) away.
""Tikal's reservoirs could hold more than 900,000 cubic meters of water,"" Lucero wrote. Estimates suggest that up to 80,000 people lived in the city and its environs in the Late Classic period, roughly 600 to 800 C.E. The reservoirs kept people and crops hydrated during the dry season, Lucero said.
Maya royalty got much of their status from their ability to provide water to the populace.
""Clean water and political power were inextricably linked -- as demonstrated by the fact that the largest reservoirs were built near palaces and temples,"" Lucero wrote. The kings also performed ceremonies to gain the favor of ancestors and the rain god, Chahk.

A key challenge was to keep standing water in reservoirs from becoming stagnant and undrinkable, and for that the Maya likely relied on aquatic plants, many of which still populate Central American wetlands today, Lucero said. These include cattails, sedges, reeds and others. Some of these plants have been identified in sediment cores from Maya reservoirs.
These plants filtered the water, reducing murkiness and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus, Lucero said.
""The Maya would have had to dredge every several years… (and) harvest and replenish aquatic plants,"" she wrote. The nutrient-laden soils and plants removed from reservoirs could then be used to fertilize urban fields and gardens.
The most iconic aquatic plant associated with the ancient Maya is the water lily, Nymphaea ampla, which thrives only in clean water, Lucero said. Its pollen has been found in sediment cores from several Maya reservoirs. Water lilies symbolized ""Classic Maya kingship,"" Lucero wrote.
""The kings even donned headdresses adorned with the flowers and are depicted with water lilies in Maya art,"" Lucero said.
""Water lilies do not tolerate acidic conditions or too much calcium such as limestone or high concentrations of certain minerals like iron and manganese,"" she wrote.

To keep water lilies alive, water managers would have had to line the reservoirs with clay, Lucero said. A layer of sediment would be needed for plants' roots. In turn, the water lilies and trees and shrubs planted near the reservoirs shaded the water, cooling it and inhibiting the growth of algae.
""The Maya generally did not build residences near reservoir edges, so contamination seeping through the karstic terrain would not have been an issue,"" Lucero wrote.
The evidence gathered from several southern lowland cities indicates that, as constructed wetlands, Maya reservoirs supplied potable water to people for more than 1,000 years, failing only when the severest droughts took hold in the region between 800 and 900 C.E., Lucero said. She notes that current climate trends will require many of the same approaches the Maya employed, including the use of aquatic plants to improve and maintain water quality naturally.
""Constructed wetlands provide many advantages over conventional wastewater treatment systems,"" she wrote. ""They provide an economical, low technology, less expensive and high energy-saving treatment technology.""
In addition to providing clean water, constructed wetlands also support aquatic animals and can be a source of nutrients to replenish agricultural soils, she wrote.
""The next step moving forward is to combine our respective expertise and implement the lessons embodied in ancient Maya reservoirs in conjunction with what is currently known about constructed wetlands,"" she wrote.

Surface water is limited because typically rain percolates through the karstic terrain. I posit that Maya reservoirs functioned as do constructed wetlands (CWs) at present. Still-water systems like CWs and Maya reservoirs can become stagnant and nonpotable due to the build-up of nutrients that promote algal growth. Stagnant waters also serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes that spread endemic diseases. CWs keep water clean via certain aquatic plants since all plants uptake nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) and decomposing plant matter supports microbial biofilms that break down nutrients. CWs also support diverse zooplankton that prey on pathogens and bacteria that assist to denitrify water. CWs do not require the use of chemicals or fossil fuels and after the initial labor-intensive output become self-cleaning and self-sufficient with some maintenance. I posit that the Maya used a diverse array of aquatic plants and other biota to keep water clean in the same manner as do CWs, which I demonstrate using evidence from excavations and settlement maps, sediment cores and current wetlands, and the iconographic and hieroglyphic records. The next step is to combine what we know about ancient Maya reservoirs in conjunction with what is currently known about CWs to better address future water needs."

Ocean currents determine the structure of the deep-sea ocean floor and the transport of sediments, organic carbon, nutrients and pollutants. In flume-tank experiments, researchers from MARUM -- Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen have simulated how currents shape the seafloor and control sediment deposition. This will help in reconstructions of past marine conditions. They have now published their results in the Nature journal Communications Earth & Environment.

Details of past climate conditions are revealed to researchers not only by sediment samples from the ocean floor, but also by the surface of the seafloor, which is exposed to currents that are constantly altering it. Deposits shaped by near-bottom currents are called contourites. These sediment deposits contain information about past ocean conditions as well as clues to climate. Contourites are often found on continental slopes or around deep-sea mountains. But they can be found in any environment where strong currents occur near the seafloor. The mechanisms that control them are not yet well understood. Experiments in flume tanks will help to change this through the depiction of deposition in future models.
Detailed observations of changes in flume-tank experiments
Henriette Wilckens, first author of the newly published study, created a replica of the continental slope in a special flume tank at the University of Utrecht (Netherlands). Currents and sediment input in the flume tank were simulated using pumps and monitored with a current meter. The formation and development of the sediment deposits were measured with a laser scanner. All the data obtained were compared to measurements in natural ocean systems in order to validate the results of the experiments.
""The internal sediment architecture of contourites can be observed from seismic data, but in order to unlock information about the past ocean currents we need a better understanding of how they developed and the factors that influence the contourite systems,"" explains Wilckens. While it is impossible to directly see how natural marine systems that developed over time periods of thousands to millions of years started to form on the seafloor, scientists can employ flume-tank experiments to directly observe detailed changes of the seafloor morphology and control their related current velocities.
Huge application potential of the models
""Our experiment can also be applied to the entire deep sea and even to lakes,"" says Henriette Wilckens, meaning anywhere in the deep sea where there is a slope, terraces, deep-sea mountains or, for example, cold-water coral mounds.
It is also conceivable that the models could be applied, for example, to improve predictions of how currents transport microplastic particles or other pollutants in the ocean. ""The potential for its application,"" says Wilckens, ""is immense. The system must first be understood before it is possible to derive information from it.""
Opening a new branch of research 
""This research work is an important step toward a better understanding of the ways in which ocean currents control the deposition of particles in the seafloor, which has important implications for paleoceanographic reconstructions and benthic ecology. This introduces a new branch of research that will probably lead to even more exciting discoveries,"" according to Elda Miramontes, co-author of the study and head of the ""Sedimentology"" working group at MARUM.

A better connection between sedimentary deposits formed by bottom currents (contourites) and hydrodynamics is necessary to improve reconstructions of paleocurrent and sediment transport pathways. Here we use physical modeling in a three-dimensional flume tank to analyse the morphology and hydrodynamics of a self-emerging contourite system. The sedimentary features that developed on a flat surface parallel to a slope are an elongated depression (moat) and an associated sediment accumulation (drift). The moat-drift system can only form in the presence of a secondary flow near the seafloor that transports sediment from the slope toward the drift. The secondary flow increases with higher speeds and steeper slopes, leading to steeper adjacent drifts. This study shows how bottom currents shape the morphology of the moat-drift system and highlights their potential to estimate paleo-ocean current strength."

Palaeontologists at University College Cork (UCC) have found the first molecular evidence of phaeomelanin, the pigment that produces ginger colouration, in the fossil record.

The new study reports the preservation of molecular fragments of the pigment phaeomelanin in 10-million-year-old frogs, adding molecular analysis to the palaeontologists' arsenal when reconstructing the original colours of extinct organisms.
The study, published today in Nature Communications, was led by palaeontologists Dr Tiffany Slater and Prof. Maria McNamara of UCC's School of Biological, Earth, and Environmental Sciences (BEES) and Environmental Research Institute (ERI). They worked with an international team of scientists at Fujita Health University (Japan), Linyi University (China) and Lund University (Sweden).
Dr Slater said:
""This finding is so exciting because it puts palaeontologists in a better place to detect different melanin pigments in many more fossils.
""This will paint a more accurate picture of ancient animal colour and will answer important questions about the evolution of colours in animals. Scientists still don't know how -- or why -- phaeomelanin evolved because it is toxic to animals, but the fossil record might just unlock the mystery.""
The team performed rigorous laboratory experiments on black, ginger, and white feathers to track how phaeomelanin pigments degrade during the fossilisation process, which backs up their interpretations of the fossil chemistry.
Prof. McNamara, senior author on the study, said,
""Fossils are invariably altered by the ravages of heat and pressure during burial, but that doesn't mean that we lose all original biomolecular information. Our fossilization experiments were the key to understanding the chemistry of the fossils, and prove that traces of biomolecules can survive being cooked during the fossilization process.
""There is huge potential to explore the biochemical evolution of animals using the fossil record, when we account for chemical changes during fossilization.""

Our results reveal which molecular signatures are authentic signals for thermally matured eumelanin and phaeomelanin, which signatures are artefacts derived from the maturation of non-melanin molecules, and how these chemical data are impacted by sample preparation. Our model correctly predicts the molecular composition of eumelanins in diverse vertebrate fossils from the Miocene and Cretaceous and, critically, identifies direct molecular evidence for phaeomelanin in these fossils. This taphonomic framework adds to the geochemical toolbox that underpins reconstructions of melanin evolution and of melanin-based coloration in fossil vertebrates."

The 2021 results began a global conversation that sparked public imagination and incited dissenting commentary throughout the scientific community as to the accuracy of the ages.

""The immediate reaction in some circles of the archeological community was that the accuracy of our dating was insufficient to make the extraordinary claim that humans were present in North America during the Last Glacial Maximum. But our targeted methodology in this current research really paid off,"" said Jeff Pigati, USGS research geologist and co-lead author of a newly published study that confirms the age of the White Sands footprints.
The controversy centered on the accuracy of the original ages, which were obtained by radiocarbon dating. The age of the White Sands footprints was initially determined by dating seeds of the common aquatic plant Ruppia cirrhosa that were found in the fossilized impressions. But aquatic plants can acquire carbon from dissolved carbon atoms in the water rather than ambient air, which can potentially cause the measured ages to be too old.
""Even as the original work was being published, we were forging ahead to test our results with multiple lines of evidence,"" said Kathleen Springer, USGS research geologist and co-lead author on the current Science paper. ""We were confident in our original ages, as well as the strong geologic, hydrologic, and stratigraphic evidence, but we knew that independent chronologic control was critical.""
For their follow-up study, the researchers focused on radiocarbon dating of conifer pollen, because it comes from terrestrial plants and therefore avoids potential issues that arise when dating aquatic plants like Ruppia. The researchers used painstaking procedures to isolate approximately 75,000 pollen grains for each sample they dated. Importantly, the pollen samples were collected from the exact same layers as the original seeds, so a direct comparison could be made. In each case, the pollen age was statistically identical to the corresponding seed age.
""Pollen samples also helped us understand the broader environmental context at the time the footprints were made,"" said David Wahl, USGS research geographer and a co-author on the current Science article. ""The pollen in the samples came from plants typically found in cold and wet glacial conditions, in stark contrast with pollen from the modern playa which reflects the desert vegetation found there today.""
In addition to the pollen samples, the team used a different type of dating called optically stimulated luminescence, which dates the last time quartz grains were exposed to sunlight. Using this method, they found that quartz samples collected within the footprint-bearing layers had a minimum age of ~21,500 years, providing further support to the radiocarbon results.
With three separate lines of evidence pointing to the same approximate age, it is highly unlikely that they are all incorrect or biased and, taken together, provide strong support for the 21,000 to 23,000-year age range for the footprints.
The research team included scientists from the USGS, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the National Park Service, and academic institutions. Their continued studies at White Sands focus on the environmental conditions that allowed people to thrive in southern New Mexico during the Last Glacial Maximum and are supported by the Climate Research and Development Program | U.S. Geological Survey and USGS-NPS Natural Resources Protection Program.

Scientists testing a new method of sequencing single cells have unexpectedly changed our understanding of the rules of genetics.

The genome of a protist has revealed a seemingly unique divergence in the DNA code signalling the end of a gene, suggesting the need for further research to better understand this group of diverse organisms.
Dr Jamie McGowan, a postdoctoral scientist at the Earlham Institute, analysed the genome sequence of a microscopic organism -- a protist -- isolated from a freshwater pond at Oxford University Parks.
The work was intended to test a DNA sequencing pipeline to work with very small amounts of DNA, such as DNA from a single cell. Dr McGowan was working with a team of scientists at the Earlham Institute and with Professor Thomas Richards' group at the University of Oxford.
But, when researchers looked at the genetic code, the protist Oligohymenophorea sp. PL0344 turned out to be a novel species with an unlikely change in how its DNA is translated into proteins.
Dr McGowan said: ""It's sheer luck we chose this protist to test our sequencing pipeline, and it just shows what's out there, highlighting just how little we know about the genetics of protists.""
It is hard to make any statements about protists as a group. Most are microscopic, single-celled organisms like amoebas, algae, and diatoms, but larger multicellular protists exist -- such as kelp, slime moulds, and red algae.

""The definition of a protist is loose -- essentially it is any eukaryotic organism which is not an animal, plant, or fungus,"" said Dr McGowan. ""This is obviously very general, and that's because protists are an extremely variable group.
""Some are more closely related to animals, some more closely related to plants. There are hunters and prey, parasites and hosts, swimmers and sitters, and there are those with varied diets while others photosynthesise. Basically, we can make very few generalisations.""
Oligohymenophorea sp. PL0344 is a ciliate. These swimming protists can be seen with a microscope and are found almost anywhere there is water.
Ciliates are hotspots for genetic code changes, including reassignment of one or more stop codons -- the codons TAA, TAG, and TGA. In virtually all organisms, these three stop codons are used to signal the end of a gene.
Variations in the genetic code are extremely rare. Among the few variants of the genetic code reported to date, the codons TAA and TAG virtually always have the same translation, suggesting that their evolution is coupled.
""In almost every other case we know of, TAA and TAG change in tandem,"" explained Dr McGowan. ""When they aren't stop codons, they each specify the same amino acid.""
DNA is like a blueprint of a building. It does not do anything in and of itself -- it provides instructions for work to be done. In order for a gene to have an impact, the blueprint must be ""read"" and then built into a molecule which has a physical effect.

For DNA to be read, it is first transcribed into an RNA copy. This copy is taken to another area of the cell where it is translated into amino acids, which are combined to make a three-dimensional molecule. The translation process starts at the DNA start codon (ATG) and finishes at a stop codon (normally TAA, TAG, or TGA).
In Oligohymenophorea sp. PL0344, only TGA functions as a stop codon -- although Dr McGowan found there are more TGA codons than expected in the ciliate's DNA, believed to compensate for the loss of the other two. Instead, TAA specifies lysine and TAG specifies glutamic acid.
""This is extremely unusual,"" Dr McGowan said. ""We're not aware of any other case where these stop codons are linked to two different amino acids. It breaks some of the rules we thought we knew about gene translation -- these two codons were thought to be coupled.
""Scientists attempt to engineer new genetic codes -- but they are also out there in nature. There are fascinating things we can find, if we look for them.
""Or, in this case, when we are not looking for them.""

Here, we report the genome and transcriptome sequencing of a novel uncultured ciliate, belonging to the Oligohymenophorea class, where the translation of the UAA and UAG stop codons have changed to specify different amino acids. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that UAA has been reassigned to encode lysine, while UAG has been reassigned to encode glutamic acid. We identified multiple suppressor tRNA genes with anticodons complementary to the reassigned codons. We show that the retained UGA stop codon is enriched in the 3’UTR immediately downstream of the coding region of genes, suggesting that there is functional drive to maintain tandem stop codons. Using a phylogenomics approach, we reconstructed the ciliate phylogeny and mapped genetic code changes, highlighting the remarkable number of independent genetic code changes within the Ciliophora group of protists. According to our knowledge, this is the first report of a genetic code variant where UAA and UAG encode different amino acids."

Fossil researchers have discovered a novel genus and species of tiny wasp with a mysterious, bulbous structure at the end of each antenna.

The female micro-wasp was described from 100-million-year-old Burmese amber in a study led by George Poinar Jr., who holds a courtesy appointment in the Oregon State University College of Science.
Poinar and Fernando Vega, an independent researcher based in Silver Spring, Maryland, have some ideas about the ""clouds"" on the antennae, but they don't know for sure what they are.
""We could find no fossil or extant insect with such antennal structures,"" said Poinar, an international expert in using plant and animal life forms preserved in amber to learn about the biology and ecology of the distant past. ""We wondered how it could still fly with that weight.""
Micro-wasps are defined as those with an adult body length of less than 2 millimeters. There are thousands of species of these parasitic insects around today, spread among hundreds of genera, Poinar said. Some are useful for controlling scale insects, which can be crop pests, he added.
""This micro-wasp has a length of only 1.3 millimeters,"" Poinar said. ""That, as well as its 15-segment antennae, a deep cleft in the center of its head and characters of the wings distinguish it from all other micro-wasps. The unique, miniature cloudlike structures stuck to the antennae must have certainly been an annoyance to this tiny parasite.""
Since the researchers could not find such structures on any other insect, current or extinct, they can only make educated guesses as to what they could be.
""They could be tiny plant seeds, plant secretions or eggs from a host the wasp was parasitizing,"" Poinar said. ""There is a good possibility the micro-wasp was parasitizing scale insects since there is a male scale insect embedded in the same piece of amber. Whatever they are, discovering these is one of the things that makes our work so interesting, and challenging: finding dominant, unique features on extinct organisms.""
The scientists named the new specimen Caradiophyodus saradae. The genus takes its name from the Greek words for head (kara) and cleft (diaphyodus), and the species name is a nod to fellow scientist Sarada Krishnan.

Paleolithic human populations survived even in the coldest and driest upland parts of Spain, according to a study published October 4, 2023 in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Manuel Alcaraz-Castaño of the University of Alcalá, Spain, Javier Aragoncillo-del Rió of the Molina-Alto Tajo UNESCO Global Geopark, Spain and colleagues.

Research into ancient hunter-gatherer populations of the Iberian Peninsula has mainly focused on coastal regions, with relatively little investigation into the inland. A classic hypothesis has been that the cold and dry conditions of inland Iberia would have been too harsh for such populations to inhabit during the coldest periods of the Last Glacial, but recent findings have begun to challenge this view. In this study, researchers report new evidence for high-altitude human occupation from the Upper Paleolithic of Spain.
This evidence comes from a site called Charco Verde II, located in the Guadalajara province. This site is situated over 1,000 meters above sea level, in one of the coldest regions of Spain. Despite this, the abundance of tools and ornaments at the site reveals a recurring sequence of human occupation between around 21,000 and 15,000 years ago. This time span is especially notable since it includes two of the coldest periods of the Last Glacial.
This discovery further challenges the idea that Upper Palaeolithic humans avoided inland Iberia due to its harsh climate, and instead shows that the inland hosted complex and relatively dense settlements even during very cold and arid periods. These findings add to the growing evidence for Middle and Upper Paleolithic occupations throughout this region, altogether indicating that the historic lack of evidence for hunter-gatherer sites in inland Iberia is not an accurate reflection of prehistoric human distributions, but instead a result of modern research hitherto prioritizing study of coastal regions and neglecting the inland.

In the Iberian Peninsula, a key area for studying human adaptations to such environments is composed by the large interior and upland regions of the northern and southern plateaus (Mesetas) and bordering areas. As, traditionally, these regions have been relatively under-investigated compared to the ecologically more favored coastal areas of the peninsula, our knowledge of the human settlement of the whole Iberian hinterland remains scarce for the Last Glacial. In this paper we present the discovery and first geoarcheological, paleoenvironmental and chronometric evidence obtained at Charco Verde II, a new site close to the southwestern foothills of the Iberian system range (Guadalajara province, Spain), bearing a sequence of Magdalenian human occupations starting at least at 20.8–21.4 ka cal BP during the Last Glacial Maximum, and covering Greenland Stadial 2 until ∼15.1–16.6 ka cal BP, including Heinrich stadial 1. As this site is located in an upland region which today faces one of the harshest climates in Iberia, such occupation sequence, occurred during some of the coldest and most arid phases of the Last Glacial, has relevant implications for our understanding of human-environment-climate interactions and population dynamics in Iberia and Western Europe. These findings support the hypothesis that the Iberian hinterland was not avoided by Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers due to ecological constraints, but it hosted a complex and relatively dense settlement at least in some areas, even during cold periods. This suggest, one more time, that the historical scarcity of Upper Paleolithic sites in inland Iberia is, to a significant extent, an artifact of research bias."

In recent years, studies have revealed that the now-arid region of northern Arabia was once much wetter and greener, providing Neolithic human populations with access to both water and game. The present aridity of the region, however, preserves little organic matter, making a reconstruction of the Neolithic lifestyle difficult.

Now, in a new study published in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology, the National Research Council of Italy, Institute of Heritage Science (CNR ISPC), and University College Londonpresent use-wear analysis of grinding tools recovered from Jebel Oraf in the Nefud desert of Saudi Arabia, revealing new insights into this little-understood chapter of the human story. Use-wear analysis shows that grinding tools were used for the processing of bone, pigment and plants, and were sometimes re-used for different purposes during their life span, before finally being broken up and placed on hearths.
In the new study, researchers use high-powered microscopes to compare use-wear patterns on the archaeological tools with those on experimental tools. In experiments, the grinding of grains, other plants, bone or pigment produces distinctive macro- and micro-traces on the tools' used surface, including fractures, edge rounding of individual grains, levelled areas, striations, and different types of polish. These distinctive traces were also identified on the Neolithic grinding tools, allowing the scientists to determine which materials were being processed.
Although faunal remains have previously revealed that meat was cooked and consumed at Jebel Oraf, wear patterns indicate that meat and bones were first processed on grindstones, revealing the possibility that bones were broken to access bone marrow.
Grinding tools were also used to process plants. While there is no evidence for domesticated grains in northern Arabia in this period, the authors argue that wild plants were ground and perhaps baked into simple breads.
""The hearths where we found the grinding tools were extremely short-lived, and people may have been very mobile -- breads would have made a good and easily transportable food for them,"" says Maria Guagnin, researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology and one of the study's lead authors.
The researchers also found evidence of pigment processing, which they argue may be linked to Neolithic paintings. Their findings reveal that pigment was ground and processed on a much larger scale than previously assumed, suggesting there may have been more painted Neolithic rock art than the few surviving panels suggest.
""It is clear grinding tools were important for the Neolithic occupants of Jebel Oraf. Many were heavily used, and some even had holes in them that suggest they were transported. That means people carried heavy grinding tools with them and their functionality must have been an important element in daily life,"" says Giulio Lucarini of the National Research Council of Italy, the study's other lead author.
This type of analysis has only rarely been applied to archaeological materials from the Arabian peninsula, but can provide important information on the manufacture, use, and re-use of grinding tools, which in turn provides insight into the subsistence, economy, and art of the people who produced them.
Researchers involved in this study work in close partnership with the Saudi Ministry of Culture. Additional partners include King Saud University and key institutions in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia.

Here we describe results from use-wear analysis on five grinding tools at Jebel Oraf, demonstrating that such artefacts were used during the Neolithic for plant processing, bone processing, and pigment production. Grinding stones were often broken up after initial use and fragments were subsequently re-used for alternative purposes, before finally being placed on hearths or discarded. More specifically, plants were ground or prepared and possibly cooked in the hearths, and bones were processed as well. The analyses also highlight the importance of pigment processing at Neolithic sites and provide a link to painted rock art. The frequent use of pigment in the archaeological record suggests that pigment was widely used, and that Neolithic painted art may have been more common than the surviving images suggest."

An international team of scientists has found early human migrants left Africa for Eurasia, across the Sinai peninsula and on through Jordan, over 80-thousand years ago.

Researchers from the University of Southampton (UK) and Shantou University (China), together with colleagues in Jordan, Australia and the Czech Republic, have proved there was a ""well-watered corridor"" which funnelled hunter-gatherers through The Levant towards western Asia and northern Arabia via Jordan.
Their findings, published in the journal Science Advances, support previous research conducted in Arabia suggesting this green, overland route, which is now desert, was favoured by travelling Homo sapiens heading north.
'Modern' humans evolved in Africa between 300 and 200 thousand years ago and dispersed out of the continent in several stages. It's thought that over tens of thousands of years they went on to populate Asia and then Europe.
For this latest research, the team conducted fieldwork in the Jordan Rift Valley where they uncovered hand tools, known as 'flakes', on the edge of wadis -- now dry river channels which, tens of thousands of years ago, were full of water. The scientists used luminescence dating techniques to help establish the age of the sediment the tools were buried in. This method estimates how long it has been since sediment was last exposed to light.
The results showed the tools were likely to have been used approximately 84 thousand years ago and then abandoned on the banks of the wadis and subsequently buried over time.
Paul Carling, Professor of Geomorphology at the University of Southampton, comments: ""It's long been thought that when the sea level was low, humans used a southern crossing, via the Red Sea from the horn of Africa, to get to southwestern Arabia. However, our study confirms there was a well-trodden passage to the north, across the only land-route from Africa to Eurasia.

""Our newly published evidence is a key piece of the puzzle that shows humans migrated using a northern route -- using small wetland areas as bases whilst hunting abundant wildlife in the drier grasslands. Although previous studies have looked for large lakes as potential watering holes, in fact small wetlands were very important as staging posts during the migration.""
Dr Mahmoud Abbas, the study's lead author from Shantou University, China, said: ""The Levant acted as a well-watered corridor for modern humans to disperse out of Africa during the last interglacial, and we have now demonstrated this is the case in the Jordan Rift Valley zone.
""The paleohydrological evidence from the Jordan desert enhances our understanding of the environmental setting at that time. Rather than dry desert, savannah grasslands would have provided the much-needed resources for humans to survive during their journey out of Africa and into southwest Asia and beyond.""
The researchers say their study demonstrates the intimate relationship between climate change, human survival and migrations.

Wetland sediments in Wadi Gharandal containing Levallois artifacts yielded an age of 84 ka. Our findings support the growing consensus for a well-watered Jordan Rift Valley that funneled migrants into western Asia and northern Arabia."

An international team of researchers has developed a new theoretical framework that bridges physics and biology to provide a unified approach for understanding how complexity and evolution emerge in nature. This new work on ""Assembly Theory,"" published today in Nature, represents a major advance in our fundamental comprehension of biological evolution and how it is governed by the physical laws of the universe.

This research builds on the team's previous work developing Assembly Theory as an empirically validated approach to life detection, with implications for the search for alien life and efforts to evolve new life forms in the laboratory. In prior work, the team assigned a complexity score to molecules called the molecular assembly index, based on the minimal number of bond-forming steps required to build a molecule. They showed how this index is experimentally measurable and how high values correlate with life-derived molecules.
The new study introduces mathematical formalism around a physical quantity called ""Assembly"" that captures how much selection is required to produce a given set of complex objects, based on their abundance and assembly indices.
""Assembly Theory provides a completely new lens for looking at physics, chemistry and biology as different perspectives of the same underlying reality,"" explained lead author professor Sara Walker, a theoretical physicist and origin of life researcher from Arizona State University. ""With this theory, we can start to close the gap between reductionist physics and Darwinian evolution -- it's a major step toward a fundamental theory unifying inert and living matter.""
The researchers demonstrated how Assembly Theory can be applied to quantify selection and evolution in systems ranging from simple molecules to complex polymers and cellular structures. It explains both the discovery of new objects and the selection of existing ones, allowing open-ended increases in complexity characteristic of life and technology.
""Assembly Theory provides an entirely new way to look at the matter that makes up our world, as defined not just by immutable particles but by the memory needed to build objects through selection over time,"" said professor Lee Cronin, a chemist from the University of Glasgow and co-lead author. ""With further work, this approach has the potential to transform fields from cosmology to computer science. It represents a new frontier at the intersection of physics, chemistry, biology and information theory.""
The researchers aim to further refine Assembly Theory and explore its applications for characterizing known and unknown life, and testing hypotheses about how life emerges from non-living matter. ""A key feature of the theory is that it is experimentally testable,"" said Cronin. ""This opens up the exciting possibility of using Assembly Theory to design new experiments that could solve the origin of life by creating living systems from scratch in the laboratory.""
The theory opens up many new questions and research directions at the boundary of the physical and life sciences. Overall, Assembly Theory promises to provide profound new insights into the physics underlying biological complexity and evolutionary innovation.

These laws underpin life’s origin, evolution and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena. Evolutionary theory explains why some things exist and others do not through the lens of selection. To comprehend how diverse, open-ended forms can emerge from physics without an inherent design blueprint, a new approach to understanding and quantifying selection is necessary3–5. We present assembly theory (AT) as a framework that does not alter the laws of physics, but redefines the concept of an ‘object’ on which these laws act. AT conceptualizes objects not as point particles, but as entities defined by their possible formation histories. This allows objects to show evidence of selection, within well-defined boundaries of individuals or selected units. We introduce a measure called assembly (A), capturing the degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects. This approach enables us to incorporate novelty generation and selection into the physics of complex objects. It explains how these objects can be characterized through a forward dynamical process considering their assembly. By reimagining the concept of matter within assembly spaces, AT provides a powerful interface between physics and biology. It discloses a new aspect of physics emerging at the chemical scale, whereby history and causal contingency influence what exists."

Commercial whaling in the 20th century decimated populations of large whales but also appears to have had a lasting impact on the genetic diversity of today's surviving whales, new research from Oregon State University shows.

Researchers compared DNA from a collection of whale bones found on beaches near abandoned whaling stations on South Georgia Island in the south Atlantic Ocean to DNA from whales in the present-day population and found strong evidence of loss of maternal DNA lineages among blue and humpback whales.
""A maternal lineage is often associated with an animal's cultural memories such as feeding and breeding locations that are passed from one generation to the next,"" said the study's lead author, Angela Sremba, who conducted the research as part of her doctoral studies at Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute. ""If a maternal lineage is lost, that knowledge is likely also lost.""
The findings were published recently in the Journal of Heredity.
South Georgia is a remote island about 800 miles southeast of the Falkland Islands and home to several whaling stations operating from the turn of the century through the 1960s. In a little over 60 years, more than 2 million whales were killed throughout the Southern Hemisphere, of which 175,000 were killed near South Georgia.
Evidence of that slaughter is still present on the island, which is littered with thousands of whale bones -- many 100 years old or more -- that were discarded during commercial processing. Cold temperatures in the region aided in their preservation.
South Atlantic whale populations have begun to recover since commercial whaling was halted, but whale sightings around South Georgia remained low. This suggests that local populations may have been extirpated -- a term to describe a type of localized extinction, said study co-author Scott Baker, associate director of OSU's Marine Mammal Institute. Baker last visited South Georgia Island as part of a research voyage in early 2020.

""For 60 years, the whales have been absent from the South Georgia feeding grounds, suggesting that cultural memory was lost,"" said Baker, who was Sremba's Ph.D. advisor. ""The numbers of whales returning to this region today are still not large, but there is a sense that they may be rediscovering this habitat.""
To better understand how whaling may have impacted the genetic diversity of today's population, Sremba analyzed DNA extracted from bones found on South Georgia Island and compared the genetic information with previously published data from living whales in the contemporary post-whaling population.
She and colleagues identified bones of humpback, blue and fin whales, and found that while genetic diversity among the whales remains high, there are indications of a loss of maternal DNA lineages in the blue and humpback populations.
Researchers were not able to detect differences in diversity between pre- and post-whaling DNA samples from Southern Hemisphere fin whales, likely due to the limited availability of post-whaling samples.
Because some whale species can live up to 100 years, there is also a chance that some of today's whales were alive during the whaling era, said Sremba, who is now a researcher with the Cooperative Institute for Marine Ecosystem and Resources Studies at OSU's Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport.
As these whales die, that could result in further loss of additional maternal lineages. This underscores the importance of preserving genetic information from the whales now, she said.

""It's remarkable these species survived. In another 100 years, we don't know what might change, and we can't measure any change now if we don't have a good understanding of the past,"" Sremba said. ""This work provides an opportunity to reconstruct the history of these whale populations and help us understand what was truly lost due to whaling activities.""
Rising temperatures due to climate change could also lead to deterioration of the DNA in the bones on South Georgia Island, Baker said.
""This work is a way to preserve this history indefinitely,"" he said.

The effect of this exploitation on genetic diversity and population structure remains largely undescribed. Here, we compare pre- and post-whaling diversity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences for 3 great whales in the South Atlantic, such as the blue, humpback, and fin whale. Pre-whaling diversity is described from mtDNA extracted from bones collected near abandoned whaling stations, primarily from the South Atlantic island of South Georgia. These bones are known to represent the first stage of 20th century whaling and thus pre-whaling diversity of these populations. Post-whaling diversity is described from previously published studies reporting large-scale sampling of living whales in the Southern Hemisphere. Despite relatively high levels of surviving genetic diversity in the post-whaling populations, we found evidence of a probable loss of mtDNA lineages in all 3 species. This is evidenced by the detection of a large number of haplotypes found in the pre-whaling samples that are not present in the post-whaling samples. A rarefaction analysis further supports a loss of haplotypes in the South Atlantic humpback and Antarctic blue whale populations. The bones from former whaling stations in the South Atlantic represent a remarkable molecular archive for further investigation of the decline and ongoing recovery in the great whales of the Southern Hemisphere."

Even the remarkably familiar can sometimes yield new discoveries: researchers at ETH Zurich recently identified a previously unknown compartment in mammalian cells. They have named it the exclusome. It is made up of DNA rings known as plasmids. The researchers now published details of their discovery in the journal Molecular Biology of the Cell.

It was in the cell plasma that the researchers found this new compartment, that is rare and hasn't been characterised before. This is exceptional because eukaryotic cells (cells with nuclei) usually keep most of their DNA in the cell nucleus, where it is organised into chromosomes.
Some of the plasmids that end up in the exclusome originate from outside the cell, while others -- known as telomeric rings -- come from the capped ends of chromosomes, the telomeres. Particularly in certain cancer cells, the ones from the telomers are regularly pinched off and joined together to form rings. However, these don't contain the blueprints for proteins. The ETH researchers have become the first to show that the cell nucleus weeds out such DNA rings and deposits them, together with the plasmids coming from outside the cell, in the cell plasma.
This proves that cells are capable of differentiating between, on the one hand, DNA that is their own and still needed and, on the other hand, DNA that is foreign or presumably no longer required, which they then eject from the nucleus. ""It's one of the key hygiene functions cells perform to protect the chromosomes. Plasmids that can't be separated off could theoretically embed themselves in the chromosomes. More likely is that the nuclear plasmid genes of viruses or bacteria are translated into proteins, which disrupts the cell physiology,"" says Ruth Kroschewski from the Institute of Biochemistry at ETH Zurich.
Does the exclusome trigger autoimmune responses?
It's not yet clear what other functions the exclusome performs. Kroschewski, who coordinated the study, believes the exclusome could play a role in cellular immunological memory. For many years now, biologists all over the world have been studying a special protein that latches on to DNA, especially to that found in cell plasma. It has already been established that this protein binds on to DNA rings as well. In doing so, it possibly triggers a signal cascade that prompts cells to produce and release inflammatory messenger substances. These tell the body that there might be a problem with a pathogen, such as a virus, that warrants an immune response.
Kroschewski and her team think it's possible that the protein in question latches on to the DNA rings present in the exclusome, resulting in the prolonged illusion of an infection. ""The body keeps getting the signal that the problem is still there,"" says the researcher. This means the immune system has no choice but to respond to the inflammatory messenger, she says. ""And as the pro-inflammatory signalling cascade doesn't subside but rather continues, this may well facilitate autoimmune responses such as systemic lupus erythematosus,"" Kroschewski explains.

A remnant of evolution
Kroschewski presumes that the exclusome dates back to early evolution when eukaryotes emerged. It's commonly understood that the first eukaryotic cells resulted from the fusion of an early form of bacteria with an archaeon, a single-celled organism similar to a bacterium. Their ring-shaped DNA, which came from the two different organisms, had to be organised and protected against degradation. As evolution advanced, a mechanism developed to ensure that DNA molecules were automatically enclosed in a membrane envelope -- which is happening at the newly discovered exclusome.
Although the exclusome envelope resembles that of the cell nucleus, it is much simpler, as Kroschewski explains: ""The exclusome envelope features gaps that can be seen in the nuclear envelope only in the early stages of its formation."" In the case of the nuclear envelope, these gaps close over time or are filled in with specific pore proteins. By contrast, the exclusome envelope does not develop any further. ""Perhaps the exclusome is a first attempt at producing a cell nucleus,"" Kroschewski says.
Why plasmids get wrapped up in an incomplete membrane envelope remains unclear. ""It looks like only chromosomal DNA is deemed 'good enough' to be encased within a fully formed nuclear envelope, and extra-chromosomal DNA is not,"" Kroschewski says. Ring-shaped DNA from outside and self-made plasmids with the sequence from chromosome ends appear to lack the required characteristic. ""We don't yet know what this characteristic is,"" Kroschewski says. The same holds true for so many aspects of this recently discovered organelle. The ETH cell biologist and her team now plan to unravel the mysteries of the exclusome by examining cellular changes at the plasmid DNA as well as the ""licence"" for depositing plasmids into the exclusome.

An international team of researchers has released a landmark study on contemporary evolutionary change in natural populations. Their study uses one of the largest genomic datasets ever produced for animals in their natural environment, comprising nearly 4,000 Darwin's finches. The study has revealed the genetic basis of adaptation in this iconic group. The results are published in the journal Science.

Ever since Darwin wrote about the finches of the Galápagos Islands, biologists have studied these small songbirds to understand the mechanisms of evolution. One ancestral species has evolved into 18 different species in the last million years. The strength of Darwin's finches as a study organism lies in what they can show about the early stages of speciation. Peter and Rosemary Grant (Princeton University) tracked nearly every individual on Daphne Major starting in the 1970s. Their work demonstrates that the finches of Daphne Major evolved in response to changes in the environment and interactions among species. An international team has sequenced the genomes of nearly every finch studied on Daphne and revealed the genetic architecture of adaptive change.
""I think it's a really exciting opportunity to tie together our understanding of evolutionary change in the deep past with observations in current time,"" says Erik Enbody, the lead author of the study and former post-doctoral fellow at Uppsala University. ""Genomic data is a powerful tool to take our observations of birds in the field and learn about the factors that have shaped their evolution,"" adding that this kind of study at this scale couldn't be possible without the decades of research on Galápagos.
""One of the remarkable things we found is that only a few genetic loci explain a great deal of the variation in the beak of the finch,"" says Leif Andersson (Uppsala University and Texas A&M University), senior author of the study. ""It seems that one of the ways these genetic changes evolve is by bundling together multiple genes, which are then subject to natural selection as the environment changes.""
These results may surprise human geneticists, where many genetic variants each are only responsible for a small amount of variation in human height, for instance.
Over the three decades studied, the beak of the Medium Ground-Finch has become smaller. Using the genomes of all the finches on Daphne, the researchers show that this results from genes transferring from the Small Ground-Finch through hybridisation and periods of drought where individuals with smaller beaks survived better.
""This study highlights the value of long-term studies to understand the mechanism of evolutionary change,"" says Peter Grant.
The researchers collected a drop of blood from the wing vein and banded each bird. This allowed them to track them and determine how long they survived, who they mated with, and their offspring.
""By collecting blood samples throughout the study, we had the samples available for genomic study when the technology became available,"" adds Rosemary Grant.
The researchers studied not only the Medium Ground-Finch, but the entire community of four species of finches present on the island. The Common Cactus-Finch experienced a gradual change towards blunter beaks as conditions on the island changed and hybridisation with the Medium Ground-Finch increased. This study paints a dynamic picture of how species adapt to changing environments through a combination of genetic changes of large phenotypic effects that are sometimes transferred between species. As the global environment continues to change, the finches of the Galápagos island will provide a valuable window into understanding how birds, their genetic constitution, and their environment interact to shape the future of wild populations.

The major locus is a supergene comprising four genes. Abrupt changes in allele frequencies at the loci accompanied a strong change in beak size caused by natural selection during a drought. A gradual change in Geospiza scandens occurred across 30 years as a result of introgressive hybridization with G. fortis . This study shows how a few loci with large effect on a fitness-related trait contribute to the genetic potential for rapid adaptive radiation."

By studying fossils from ancient aquatic plants, Northwestern University and University of Wyoming (UW) researchers are gaining a better understanding of how methane produced in Arctic lakes might affect -- and be affected by -- climate change.

In a new study, the researchers examined the waxy coatings of leaves preserved as organic molecules within sediment from the early-to-middle Holocene, a period of intense warming that occurred due to slow changes in Earth's orbit 11,700 to 4,200 years ago. These wax biomarkers -- which were once a part of common aquatic brown mosses -- were preserved in sediment buried beneath four lakes in Greenland.
By studying these biomarkers, the researchers discovered that past warming during the middle Holocene caused lakes across a wide range of Greenland's climates to generate methane. Because methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, any changes in methane production with warming are important to understand.
Currently, researchers have incomplete knowledge of how much methane is produced in Arctic lakes and how ongoing warming will affect methane production. The new study suggests that warming potentially could lead to a previously under-appreciated flux in methane emissions from lakes.
The study will be published on Friday (Sept. 29) in the journal Science Advances.
""Last time Greenland lakes experienced major warming, we were coming out of the last ice age, and it took some time for the conditions to develop for lake methane cycling to increase,"" said Jamie McFarlin, who led the study. ""But once it developed, the lakes in our study maintained an intensified methane cycle for thousands of years until the onset of the naturally driven late Holocene cooling. This supports a climate dependence on lake methane cycling in some Arctic lakes.""
""These data show increased periods of methane cycling during past warm periods,"" added Magdalena Osburn, the study's senior author. ""Living on a warming planet, we can look to these signs from the past to help predict our future. We suspect this process is going to become more and more important in the future of these lakes.""
When the research began, McFarlin was a Ph.D. student at Northwestern; now she is an assistant professor at UW. Osburn is an associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Osburn co-advised McFarlin with Yarrow Axford, William Deering Professor in Geological Sciences at Weinberg College and the paper's second author.

Lakes act as significant natural sources of methane, but exactly how much methane production will change with ongoing warming within Arctic lakes is not fully quantified. And because Arctic and boreal landscapes are the fastest warming regions on Earth, it is imperative for researchers to better understand the dynamics between warming temperatures and methane production in these lakes.
To explore these dynamics, the researchers produced new data at two lakes (Wax Lips Lake and Trifna Sø) and reviewed published data from two additional lakes on Greenland (Lake N3 and Pluto Lake). They compared the hydrogen isotopic composition of aquatic plant waxes within the sediment to biomarkers from terrestrial plants and other sources. The isotopic composition of biomarkers from aquatic plants revealed a signature from methane during the early-middle Holocene at most sites.
Because these plants absorb methane, they might mitigate some of the methane produced in lakes before it is emitted into the atmosphere.
""In the lakes in our study, some methane was taken up by aquatic mosses living in the lakes -- likely through a symbiotic association with a type of bacteria that eats methane,"" McFarlin said. ""We do not know yet how much methane was produced versus consumed in these lakes during the time period of our study, so the overall effect on the atmosphere remains unclear. The uptake of methane into plants is likely restricted to very specific types of aquatic mosses, however, so not all lakes or even all Arctic lakes will have these same dynamics.""
""The Arctic has huge areas covered in lakes,"" Axford said. ""Not every lake has mosses that will record methane dynamics, but our study also highlights that those vast swaths of Arctic lakes are vulnerable to climate-driven changes in methane cycling, whether mosses are on site to witness those changes or not. This is yet another way that rapid warming in the Arctic could affect global climate.""

Here, we demonstrate that the hydrogen isotopic composition (δ 2 H) of mid-chain waxes derived from aquatic moss clearly decouples from precipitation during past Holocene warmth and instead records incorporation of methane in plant biomass. Trends in δ 2 H moss and δ 13 C moss values point to widespread Middle Holocene (11,700 to 4200 years ago) shifts in lake methane cycling across Greenland during millennia of elevated summer temperatures, heightened productivity, and lowered hypolimnetic oxygen. These data reveal ongoing warming may lead to increases in methane-derived C in many Arctic lakes, including lakes where methane is not a major component of the C cycle today. This work highlights a previously unrecognized mechanism influencing δ 2 H values of mid-chain wax and draws attention to the unquantified role of common aquatic mosses as a potentially important sink of lake methane across the Arctic."

Recent study sheds new light on the enigmatic early evolution of snakes by examining an unexpected source: their brains. The results emphasise the significance of studying both the soft parts of animals' bodies and their bones for understanding how animals evolved.

Snakes are fascinating creatures, forming about one-eighth of vertebrate animals found on land. They come in a wide range of forms and sizes and have adjusted to different ways of life, such as living underground, on the land, in water, and up in trees. However, the early evolution of snakes and the changes in their morphologies over time has been long debated in the field of biology.
To help unravel this mystery, researchers from the HiLIFE Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki used a different way of studying snake evolution.
""Instead of relying on rare, old fossil remains to learn about the history of snakes, we looked at the brains of living reptiles and traveled back in time, thanks to modern imaging and analysis tools"" says the first author of the study, Postdoctoral Researcher Simone Macrì.
By using high-definition 3D models of modern lizard and snake brains, researchers reconstructed the brain shape of early snakes and discovered that they were fully adapted for underground living. Nevertheless, early snakes also displayed versatile behaviors, as evidenced by the mixture of different features and complex patterns in their brain morphologies, which may reflect differences in what they eat, how they use different environments both below and above the ground, and their ability to search for food.
Understanding animal evolution beyond fossils
""What's really exciting is that this study is not only about snakes! It's also showing us a way to learn about other animals whose history is a bit of a mystery because we lack fossils for studying them,"" describes Principal Investigator Nicolas Di-Poï, Research Director at the Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki.
By examining both present-day animals and those from the past, along with bones and different crucial organs like the brain, scientists can piece together the story of how these creatures changed and evolved over time.
This research underscores a vital lesson for the field of biology: unraveling the mysteries of animal evolution goes beyond the analysis of bone remains. To comprehend the transformation of creatures like snakes over time, scientists must consider other components of their bodies, including soft tissues and internal organs. This is particularly crucial when studying animals from eras when their bones might not have been well-preserved.

Our predictive models revealed a burrowing lifestyle with opportunistic behavior at the origin of crown snakes, reflecting a complex ancestral mosaic brain pattern. These findings emphasize the importance of quantitatively tracking the phenotypic diversification of soft tissues—including the accurate definition of intact brain morphological traits such as the cerebellum—in understanding snake evolution and vertebrate paleobiology. Furthermore, our study highlights the power of combining extant and extinct species, soft tissue reconstructions, and osteological traits in tracing the deep evolution of not only snakes but also other groups where fossil data are scarce."

Were the first animals predators or filter feeders like the sponges living in today's oceans? And what role did symbiosis with algae play, as with reef-building corals? Surprising findings by a research group led by Prof. Dr Thomas W. Holstein of Heidelberg University on the development of sea anemones suggest that a predatory lifestyle moulded their evolution and had a significant impact on the origin of their nervous system. The researchers were able to show that the young life stages (larvae) of the small sea anemone Aiptasia actively feed on living prey and are not dependent on algae. To capture its prey, the anemone larvae use specialised stinging cells and a simple neuronal network.

In the early embryonic development of multicellular organisms, gastrulation plays a key role. ""In its simplest form, the gastrula develops from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, forming a larval stage with gut and mouth; imagine pushing a ball inwards at one side. All animals pass through this gastrula stage, which could also have existed at the beginning of animal evolution,"" explains Prof. Holstein, a development and evolutionary biologist at the Centre for Organismal Studies (COS) at Ruperto Carola. Ira Mägele, a member of his research group, succeeded in proving that already in the late gastrula stage, the larvae of the Aiptasia sea anemone capture prey of suitable size with their stinging cells, ingest them with their mouth and digest them in their primitive gut.
The Aiptasia sea anemone is a model system for research on endosymbiosis in corals and other cnidarians. ""Corals live in nutrient-poor waters and as larvae or young polyps, take up symbiotic algae cells. In Aiptasia, however, this process is important for adults but does not lead to growth and settlement of the larvae, suggesting that nutrition is a critical step in closing the life cycle,"" states Thomas Holstein. Laboratory studies of the nutritional conditions showed that the food for the tiny Aiptasia larvae had to be small enough and alive. Nauplius larvae of Tisbe copepods, 50 to 80 micrometres small, are of similar size to Aiptasia larvae, making them an ideal food.
The larvae increase continually and rapidly in size, followed by settlement on the substrate and metamorphosis into primary polyps. ""In this way, we were able to grow mature polyps as well as their descendants for the first time,"" explains Ira Mägele. Dr Elizabeth Hambleton, a participating researcher from the University of Vienna (Austria), stresses: ""By thus closing the life cycle of Aiptasia, it will finally be possible to carry out necessary molecular genetic experiments required for functional studies on this key endosymbiotic model organism."" Prof. Dr Annika Guse from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, also a study co-author, views this experimental approach as a breakthrough for work on this model system.
As Prof. Holstein underscores, the data obtained paint a new picture of the predatory lifestyle as a primary characteristic of the cnidarian gastrula. Evolutionary theorist Ernst Haeckel (1834 to 1919) first posed the ""gastrula hypothesis."" ""But Haeckel's hypothetical gastrula was a particle-filtering life form, like sponges. In contrast, the predatory gastrula of Aiptasia and other cnidarians possess specialised stinging cells used for capturing prey."" The predatory lifestyle of gastrula-like forms with extrusive organelles that excrete toxins and are likewise found in single-celled organisms and simple worms, adds the Heidelberg biologist, could have been a critical driver of the early evolution of multicellular organisms and the development of complex, organised nervous systems.
The results of the study were published in the journal PNAS. Funding was provided by the German Research Foundation as part of Heidelberg University's ""Mechanisms and Functions of Wnt Signaling"" Collaborative Research Centre as well as the ERC Consolidator Grant ""SYMCELLS -- Resolving the molecular mechanisms of intracellular coral-algal symbiosis"" led by Prof. Guse.

This has been a major obstacle in their use as a model for coral–dinoflagellate endosymbiosis. Here, we show that Aiptasia larvae actively feed on crustacean nauplii, displaying a preference for live prey. This feeding behavior relies on functional stinging cells, indicative of complex neuronal control. Regular feeding leads to significant size increase, morphological changes, and efficient settlement around 14 d postfertilization. Surprisingly, the presence of dinoflagellate endosymbionts does not affect larval growth or settlement dynamics but is crucial for sexual reproduction. Our findings finally close Aiptasia’s life cycle and highlight the functional nature of its larvae, as in Haeckel’s Gastrea postulate, yet reveal its active carnivory, thus contributing to our understanding of early metazoan evolution."

A team of scientists, led by researchers from the Universidad de Alcalá (UAH) and the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), has discovered and analyzed the first direct evidence of basketry among hunter-gatherer societies and early farmers in southern Europe in the Cueva de los Murciélagos of Albuñol (Granada, Spain).

Their work, published in the prestigious journal Science Advances, analyzes 76 objects made of organic materials (wood, reed and esparto) discovered during 19th century mining activities in the Granada cave. The researchers studied the raw materials and technology and carried out carbon-14 dating, which revealed that the set dates to the early and middle Holocene period, between 9,500 and 6,200 years ago. This is the first direct evidence of basketry made by Mesolithic hunter-gatherer societies in southern Europe and a unique set of other organic tools associated with early Neolithic farming communities, such as sandals and a wooden mace.
As researcher of the Prehistory Department of the University of Alcalá Francisco Martínez Sevilla explains, ""the new dating of the esparto baskets from the Cueva de los Murciélagos of Albuñol opens a window of opportunity to understanding the last hunter-gatherer societies of the early Holocene. The quality and technological complexity of the basketry makes us question the simplistic assumptions we have about human communities prior to the arrival of agriculture in southern Europe. This work and the project that is being developed places the Cueva de los Murciélagos as a unique site in Europe to study the organic materials of prehistoric populations.""
Cueva de los Murciélagos is located on the coast of Granada, to the south of the Sierra Nevada and 2 kilometers from the town of Albuñol. The cave opens on the right side of the Barranco de las Angosturas, at an altitude of 450 meters above sea level and about 7 kilometers from the current coastline. It is one of the most emblematic prehistoric archaeological sites of the Iberian Peninsula due to the rare preservation of organic materials, which until this study had only been attributed to the Neolithic. The objects made of perishable materials were discovered by the mining activities of the 19th century and were documented and recovered by Manuel de Góngora y Martínez, later becoming part of the first collections of the National Archaeological Museum of Madrid.
As detailed by María Herrero Otal, co-author of the work and researcher at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, ""the esparto grass objects from Cueva de los Murciélagos are the oldest and best-preserved set of plant fiber materials in southern Europe so far known. The technological diversity and the treatment of the raw material documented demonstrates the ability of prehistoric communities to master this type of craftsmanship, at least since 9,500 years ago, in the Mesolithic period. Only one type of technique related to hunter-gatherers has been identified, while the typological, technological and treatment range of esparto grass was extended during the Neolithic from 7,200 to 6,200 years before the present.""
The work is part of the project ""De los museos al territorio: actualizando el estudio de la Cueva de los Murciélagos de Albuñol (Granada)"" (MUTERMUR), which has been funded by the Community of Madrid and the Universidad de Alcalá. The objective of this project is the holistic study of the site and its material record, applying the latest archaeometric techniques and generating quality scientific data. The project also included the collaboration of the National Archaeological Museum, the Archaeological and Ethnological Museum of Granada, the City Council of Albuñol and the owners of the cave.
""The results of this work and the finding of the oldest basketry in southern Europe give more meaning, if possible, to the phrase written by Manuel de Góngora in his work Prehistoric Antiquities of Andalusia (1868): 'the now forever famous Cueva de los Murciélagos',"" the authors highlight.

To help resolve the scientific debate over whether it was a giant asteroid or volcanic eruptions that wiped out the dinosaurs and most other species 66 million years ago, Dartmouth researchers tried a new approach -- they removed scientists from the debate and let the computers decide.

The researchers report in the journal Science a new modeling method powered by interconnected processors that can work through reams of geological and climate data without human input. They tasked nearly 130 processors with analyzing the fossil record in reverse to pinpoint the events and conditions that led to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event that cleared the way for the ascendance of mammals, including the primates that would lead to early humans.
""Part of our motivation was to evaluate this question without a predetermined hypothesis or bias,"" said Alex Cox, first author of the study and a graduate student in Dartmouth's Department of Earth Sciences. ""Most models move in a forward direction. We adapted a carbon-cycle model to run the other way, using the effect to find the cause through statistics, giving it only the bare minimum of prior information as it worked toward a particular outcome.
""In the end, it doesn't matter what we think or what we previously thought -- the model shows us how we got to what we see in the geological record,"" he said.
The model crunched more than 300,000 possible scenarios of carbon dioxide emissions, sulfur dioxide output, and biological productivity in the 1 million years before and after the K-Pg extinction. Through a type of machine learning known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo -- which is not unlike how a smartphone predicts what you'll type next -- the processors worked together independently to compare, revise, and recalculate their conclusions until they reached a scenario that matches the outcome preserved in the fossil record.
Geochemical and organic remnants in the fossil record capture clearly the catastrophic conditions during the K-Pg extinction, so named for the geological periods on either side of the millennia-long cataclysm. Animals and plants worldwide suffered massive die-offs as food webs collapsed under an unstable atmosphere that -- laden with sun-blotting sulfur, airborne minerals and heat-trapping carbon dioxide -- swung wildly from frigid to scorching conditions.
While the effect is clear, the cause of the extinction is unresolved. Early theories attributing the event to volcanic eruptions have been eclipsed by the discovery of an impact crater in Mexico known as Chicxulub that was caused by a miles-wide asteroid now thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction event. The theories have begun to converge, however, as fossil evidence suggests a one-two punch unlike anything in Earth's history: The asteroid may have slammed into a planet already reeling from the massive, extremely violent eruptions of volcanoes in western India's Deccan Traps.

But scientists still do not know -- nor agree on -- the extent to which each event contributed to the mass extinction. So, Cox and his adviser Brenhin Keller, a Dartmouth assistant professor of earth sciences and study co-author, decided to ""see what you would get if you let the code decide.""
Their model suggested that the outpouring of climate-altering gases from the Deccan Traps alone could have been sufficient to trigger the global extinction. The Traps had been erupting for roughly 300,000 years before the Chicxulub asteroid. During their nearly 1 million years of eruptions, the Deccan Traps are estimated to have pumped up to 10.4 trillion tons of carbon dioxide and 9.3 trillion tons of sulfur into the atmosphere.
""We've known historically that volcanoes can cause massive extinctions, but this is the first independent estimation of volatile emissions taken from the evidence of their environmental effects,"" said Keller, who published a paper last year linking four of Earth's five mass extinctions to volcanism.
""Our model worked through the data independently and without human bias to determine the amount of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide required to produce the climate and carbon cycle disruptions we see in the geologic record. These amounts turned out to be consistent with what we expect to see in emissions from the Deccan Traps,"" said Keller, who has worked extensively to examine the link between Deccan volcanism and the K-Pg extinction.
The model did reveal a steep drop in the accumulation of organic carbon in the deep ocean around the time of the Chicxulub impact, which likely resulted from the asteroid causing the demise of numerous animal and plant species. The record contains traces of a decrease in temperature around the same time that would have been caused by the large amount of sulfur -- a short-term cooling agent -- the mammoth meteorite would have ejected into the air when it collided with the sulfur-rich surface on that area of the planet.
The asteroid impact also would have likely emitted both carbon and sulfur dioxide. However, the model found that there was no spike in the emissions of either gas at that time, suggesting that the asteroid's contribution to the extinction did not hinge on gas emissions.

In modern context, Cox said, the burning of fossil fuels from 2000 to 2023 has pumped about 16 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per year. This is 100 times greater than the highest annual emission rate scientists project from the Deccan Traps. While alarming on its own, it would still take a few thousand years for current carbon dioxide emissions to match the total amount that spewed forth from the ancient volcanoes, Cox said.
""Most heartening is that the results we achieved are broadly physically plausible, which is impressive given that the model could have technically run completely wild without stronger prior constraints,"" he said.
Interconnecting the processors shortened the time it took the model to analyze such a massive data set from months or years to hours, Cox said. His and Keller's method can be used to invert other earth systems models -- such as those for the climate or carbon cycle -- to evaluate geological events for which the outcomes are well known but not the factors that led there.
""This type of parallel inversion hasn't been done in earth sciences models before. Our method can be scaled up to include thousands of processors, which gives us a much broader solution space to explore, and it's quite resistant to human bias,"" Cox said.
""So far, people in our field have been more fascinated by the novelty of the method than the conclusion we reached,"" he laughed. ""Any earth system for which we know the effect but not the cause is ripe for inversion. The better we know the output, the better we're able to characterize the input that caused it.""

In this study, we used a parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to invert for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions, export productivity, and remineralization from 67 to 65 million years ago using the LOSCAR (Long-term Ocean-atmosphere-Sediment CArbon cycle Reservoir) model. Our results closely match observed and proxy data and suggest decoupled CO 2 and SO 2 emissions, a two-step decline in export productivity with a protracted recovery, and no clear volatile impulse at the boundary. More broadly, our methods provide a potential path forward for efficient parallel inversion of complex Earth system models."

In February, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake shook the Turkey-Syria border, followed by one nearly as large nine hours later. Shallow faults less than 18 miles beneath the surface buckled and ruptured, causing violent focused quakes that leveled thousands of buildings and killed tens of thousands.

Similar shallow faults ruptured about 1,000 years ago in the Puget Lowlands in western Washington, according to new University of Arizona-led research. Tree rings helped pinpoint that the seismic event occurred in late A.D. 923 or early 924. Their findings mean that a repeat event has the potential to again shake the region that is now home to over 4 million people, including Seattle, Tacoma and Olympia. The results were published in the journal Science Advances.
The ancient quake was either the result of all the shallow faults in the region rupturing together to produce an estimated 7.8-magnitude earthquake or -- like in Turkey and Syria -- twin quakes that occurred back-to-back with estimated magnitudes of 7.5 and 7.3, researchers found. Shallow faults typically result in more violent and focused shaking than earthquakes generated from other geological configurations.
While earthquakes are not new to the Pacific Northwest, the study identified that events on these shallow faults are linked to each other in some way, either by connections underground or by one fault transferring stress to the other. Regional hazard models, used to develop engineering design and policies, don't currently reflect this possibility -- but should, said paper first author Bryan Black, an associate professor of dendrochronology in the UArizona Laboratory for Tree-Ring Research.
Homing in on the millennial cluster
Scientists have been uncovering shallow faults in the region since the 1960s, when the Seattle Fault was first discovered, followed by the Saddle Mountain Fault, which runs along the eastern foothills of the Olympic Mountains, and the Tacoma and Olympia faults.
""These are four shallow faults that had shown evidence of having ruptured roughly 1,000 years ago in a cluster of earthquakes called the millennial cluster,"" Black said. For example, ""a 25-foot cliff was thrusted into the air from west Seattle out to Puget Sound. It also triggered a local tsunami and landslides that stripped mountainsides of whole forests and discarded them into nearby lakes Washington and Sammamish.""
Until now, scientists weren't clear on exactly when and how these faults last gave out.

""These quakes could have ruptured at the same time, hours apart or centuries apart,"" Black said. ""We weren't sure.""
So, he turned to the trees.

With each passing year, trees add a ring around their trunks. The ring width is determined by the climate they experience. Favorable conditions mean wider rings and unfavorable conditions mean thinner. As climate varies from year to year, it creates time-specific patterns like a bar code in the growth of trees within a region.
Dendrochronologists can match these time-specific growth patterns in dead trees with patterns from living trees. If there is overlap with living trees, the exact dates over which the dead trees lived -- and died -- can be established. This was the approach used to determine when the earthquake-killed trees died in the Puget Sound region.
In 2021, Black trekked into the mountains of the Pacific Northwest to participate in harvesting stumps from trees that had died when the Saddle Mountain Fault impounded a stream that flooded a forest. The lake and the stumps of these drowned trees remain today.

The team strapped two canoes together and slapped a large piece of plywood atop them both to create a makeshift barge that would hold a generator to power underwater chainsaws. With these in hand, divers leaped into the water to cut samples of trees killed when the lake formed from the millennial cluster. Black and his team also had sections sourced from nearby trees killed around the same time during a rock avalanche that impounded a stream that flooded a nearby streambed. They also acquired sections from trees collected more than 30 years ago that had drowned in landslides into Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish during a large earthquake on the Seattle Fault.
When he compared the growth patterns, Black observed that the trees died the exact same year across both the Saddle Mountain and Seattle faults. He also saw that the trees died during their dormant season, which narrows the time of death -- and the earthquake by extension -- to the late fall through early spring.
To determine an exact calendar year of death, the team built a 1,300-year chronology from living but extremely old trees, which, when matched with the earthquake-killed trees, showed that the dormant season of death was late 923 to early 924.
""Our team was also lucky that there was a massive solar storm between the years 774 and 775, which caused a sudden global spike in radiocarbon,"" said associate professor of dendrochronology and co-author Charlotte Pearson. Radiocarbon fluctuations, like climate, can be used to date tree rings. ""We measured radiocarbon in the rings of earthquake-killed trees to show that this spike occurred right where we thought it should.""
This independently confirmed their earthquake date.
""Combined, the evidence showed us that these trees from across the region died together, and this was in fact a linked event,"" Black said. ""We've taken uncertainties around these two faults that used to span decades or centuries and narrowed it down to within one season. It's a much different scenario if we have earthquakes on these two faults separated by 100 years versus 100 hours. Demonstrating that these faults can rupture synchronously or in very rapid succession has really changed what we understand about the hazard in the region.""
Yet, current hazard models don't currently recognize that linked faulting is possible, he said.
""If Saddle Mountain and Seattle faults went together it would be on par with the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco,"" Black said. ""Or, like the quakes in Turkey, they can also go at rapid succession. If that were the case, the infrastructure and landforms already weakened by one quake are then going to get the knockout punch with a second quake. It will still be quite destructive: thrusting up water mains, severing roads, triggering landslides and local tsunamis.""
Luckily, he said, the bigger and more severe the quake, the less frequent it is. So, while quakes of this size would be devastating to the region, they are relatively uncommon.

Yet, the potential for linked faulting remains poorly understood given the infrequency of these events in the historic era. Geological records provide longer perspectives, although temporal uncertainties are too broad to clearly pinpoint single multifault events. Here, we use dendrochronological dating and a cosmogenic radiation pulse to constrain the death dates of earthquake-killed trees along two adjacent fault zones near Seattle, Washington to within a 6-month period between the 923 and 924 CE growing seasons. Our narrow constraints conclusively show linked rupturing that occurred either as a single composite earthquake of estimated magnitude 7.8 or as a closely spaced double earthquake sequence with estimated magnitudes of 7.5 and 7.3. These scenarios, which are not recognized in current hazard models, increase the maximum earthquake size needed for seismic preparedness and engineering design within the Puget Sound region of >4 million residents."

The grounding line of the southern Ronne Ice Shelf in Antarctica can shift up to 15 km (six miles) with changing tides, new analysis shows. The research, published today in The Cryosphere, examines the key region where land-based Antarctic ice spills over into the surrounding ocean. Observing and understanding the dynamics of this region can help scientists predict Antarctica's response to climate change, and so how much global sea levels will rise.

""We typically think of ice sheet change as being very slow, taking place over decades, centuries or even millennia. But our findings highlight that there are some processes operating over minutes to hours that may have significant impacts,"" says Bryony Freer, lead author and glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey and the Centre for Satellite Data in Environmental Science at the University of Leeds.
The location of Antarctica's grounding line -- the boundary between the land-based section of the ice sheet and the floating ice shelf -- helps control ice stability. During a rising tide, extra buoyancy lifts more of the ice shelf off the seabed and the grounding line temporarily moves inland. It returns to its seaward position at low tide.
Earlier measurements of such grounding line movement were restricted to small regions over short timescales. In the new study, the researchers monitored a large chunk of the Ronne Ice Shelf grounding line (220 km) for nearly five years.
Using lasers bounced off the ice from the orbiting satellite ICESat-2, the team could measure to within a few centimetres the height of the ice surface and how it rose and sank with daily tides. They used this information to calculate the changing position of the grounding line.
The 15 km shift in the grounding line position between high and low tide described in the new paper is the one of the largest observed anywhere in Antarctica. It shows the grounding line can move at more than 30 km per hour, flushing ocean water several kilometres further inland under the ice sheet.
This exposure to sea water could help the ice melt more quickly from below. In less stable Antarctic regions, such as the Thwaites Glacier, this process is known to have driven long-term historic grounding line retreat.

Grounding line movement depends on the tidal range, the shape of the seafloor and the strength of the ice. The new study found the grounding line in some regions moved inland much faster during a rising tide than it later returned as the tide dropped -- a particularly exciting finding according to the researchers. This is because it suggests that sea water may become trapped under the ice as the grounding line readvances and so takes longer to be flushed out, perhaps increasing the rate at which the ice sheet melts from below.
""It's vital that we improve both our observations and modelling of these tidal processes, to better understand how they operate and work out the likely implications for long-term ice sheet change,"" Freer says.
The researchers recommend that any future satellite-derived measurements of grounding line position should be timestamped to the nearest hour, along with tide height and phase. They also want to repeat the analysis across more of Antarctica.
Helen Amanda Fricker, ICESat-2 Science Team Leader and Professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, and paper co-author says:
""This work showcases how the unprecedented sampling in both space and time of ICESat-2 can reveal new information about dynamic features on ice shelves. It is critical that we continue these measurements with future missions.""

Tide-forced short-term migration of the grounding line (GL) of Antarctic ice shelves can impact ice dynamics at the ice sheet margins and obscures assessments of long-term GL advance or retreat. However, the magnitude of tidally induced GL migration is poorly known, and the spatial patterns and modes of variability are not well characterised. Here we develop and apply a technique that uses Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) repeat-track laser altimetry to locate the inland limit of tidal ice shelf flexure for each sampled tide, enabling the magnitude and temporal variability of tidal GL migration to be resolved. We demonstrate its application at an ice plain north of Bungenstockrücken, in a region of the southern Ronne Ice Shelf subject to large ocean tides. We observe a 1300 km2 area of ephemeral grounding over which the GL migrates by up to 15 km between low and high tide and identify four distinct modes of migration: linear, asymmetric, threshold and hysteresis. The short-term movement of the GL dominates any long-term migration signal in this location, and the distribution of GL positions and modes contains information about spatial variability in the ice–bed interface. We discuss the impact of extreme tidal GL migration on ice shelf–ocean–subglacial systems in Antarctica and make recommendations for how GLs should be more precisely defined and documented in future by the community."

The Western United States is losing its glaciers.

A new inventory from Portland State University researchers show that some glaciers have disappeared entirely, some no longer show movement, some are too small to meet the 0.01 square kilometer minimum and some are actually rock glaciers -- rocky debris with ice in the pore spaces.
Andrew Fountain, a geology professor emeritus at PSU, and research assistant Bryce Glenn, inventoried glaciers and perennial snowfields in the western continental U.S. using aerial and satellite imagery between 2013 and 2020. The inventory, published in the journal Earth System Science Data, identified 1,331 glaciers and 1,176 perennial snowfields.
It updates a mid-20th century inventory, derived from U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps made over a 40-year span, and provides a baseline for estimating future changes amid a warming climate.
""Glaciers are disappearing and this is a quantification of how many around us have disappeared and will probably continue to disappear,"" Fountain said.
The new inventory excludes 52 of the 612 officially named glaciers because they are no longer glaciers. The official names are those listed in the federal Geographic Names Information System -- the nation's repository for the names and locations of landscape features. Milk Lake Glacier in Washington's Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and Wyoming's Hooker Glacier have disappeared altogether; 25 were instead classified as perennial snowfields, which unlike glaciers don't move; 18 had areas smaller than the commonly used threshold of 0.01 square kilometers or roughly the size of two football fields side-by-side; and seven were considered rock glaciers.
The loss of glaciers impacts more than aesthetics. Glaciers act as a natural regulator of streamflow, Fountain said. They melt a lot during hot dry periods and don't melt much during cool rainy periods. As glaciers shrink, they have less ability to buffer seasonal runoff variations and watersheds become more susceptible to drought. Retreating glaciers also leave behind sharp, steep embankments on either side, which can collapse and result in catastrophic debris flows. Globally, the loss of glaciers is also a major contributor to sea level rise.
Fountain's co-authors are Bryce Glenn, a PSU alum and research analyst, and Christiopher McNeil, a geophysicist with the USGS' Alaska Science Center. Looking ahead, the group is studying the volume change of the glaciers to see how much ice they've lost since the USGS mapping.

A new study shows unprecedented heat is likely to lead to the next mass extinction since the dinosaurs died out, eliminating nearly all mammals in some 250 million years time.

The research, published today in Nature Geoscience and led by the University of Bristol, presents the first-ever supercomputer climate models of the distant future and demonstrates how climate extremes will dramatically intensify when the world's continents eventually merge to form one hot, dry and largely uninhabitable supercontinent.
The findings project how these high temperatures are set to further increase, as the sun becomes brighter, emitting more energy and warming the Earth. Tectonic processes, occurring in the Earth's crust and resulting in supercontinent formation would also lead to more frequent volcanic eruptions which produce huge releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, further warming the planet.
Mammals, including humans, have survived historically thanks to their ability to adjust to weather extremes, especially through adaptations such as fur and hibernating in the cold, as well as short spells of warm weather hibernation.
While mammals have evolved to lower their cold temperature survivable limit, their upper temperature tolerance has generally remained constant. This makes exposure to prolonged excessive heat much harder to overcome and the climate simulations, if realised, would ultimately prove unsurvivable.
Lead author Dr Alexander Farnsworth, Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol, said: ""The newly-emerged supercontinent would effectively create a triple whammy, comprising the continentality effect, hotter sun and more CO2 in the atmosphere, of increasing heat for much of the planet. The result is a mostly hostile environment devoid of food and water sources for mammals.
""Widespread temperatures of between 40 to 50 degrees Celsius, and even greater daily extremes, compounded by high levels of humidity would ultimately seal our fate. Humans -- along with many other species -- would expire due to their inability to shed this heat through sweat, cooling their bodies.""
Although human-induced climate change and global warming is likely to be a growing cause of heat stress and mortality in some regions, research suggests the planet should largely remain habitable until this seismic landmass change in the deep future. But when the supercontinent forms, findings indicate only somewhere between 8% and 16% of land would be habitable for mammals.

Co-author Dr Eunice Lo, Research Fellow in Climate Change and Health at the University of Bristol said: ""It is vitally important not to lose sight of our current Climate Crisis, which is a result of human emissions of greenhouse gases. While we are predicting an uninhabitable planet in 250 million years, today we are already experiencing extreme heat that is detrimental to human health. This is why it is crucial to reach net-zero emissions as soon as possible.""
The international team of scientists applied climate models, simulating temperature, wind, rain, and humidity trends for the next supercontinent -- called Pangea Ultima -- expected to form in the next 250 million years. To estimate the future level of CO2 the team used models of tectonic plate movement, ocean chemistry and biology to map out inputs and outputs of CO2.
The future CO2 calculations were led by Professor Benjamin Mills at the University of Leeds, who said: ""We think CO2 could rise from around 400 parts per million (ppm) today to more than 600 ppm many millions of years in the future. Of course, this assumes that humans will stop burning fossil fuels, otherwise we will see those numbers much, much sooner.""
Dr Farnsworth, also a visiting Professor at the Tibetan Plateau Earth System, Environment and Resources (TPESER), at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research said: ""The outlook in the distant future appears very bleak. Carbon dioxide levels could be double current levels. With the Sun also anticipated to emit about 2.5% more radiation and the supercontinent being located primarily in the hot, humid tropics, much of the planet could be facing temperatures of between 40 to 70 °C.
""This work also highlights that a world within the so-called 'habitable zone' of a solar system may not be the most hospitable for humans depending on whether the continents are dispersed, as we have today, or in one large supercontinent.""
In addition, the research illustrates the importance of tectonics and continental layouts when conducting research into planets beyond our solar system, called exoplanets. Although the Earth will still be within the habitable zone in 250 million years' time, for mammals the formation of a supercontinent with elevated carbon dioxide will make most of the world uninhabitable. The findings suggest the landmass layout for a distant world could be a key factor when determining how liveable it is for humans.
The research formed part of a funded project, funded by the UK Research and Innovation Natural Environment Research Council (UKRI NERC) looking at the climates of supercontinents and mass extinctions.

All life will eventually perish in a runaway greenhouse once absorbed solar radiation exceeds the emission of thermal radiation in several billions of years. However, conditions rendering the Earth naturally inhospitable to mammals may develop sooner because of long-term processes linked to plate tectonics (short-term perturbations are not considered here). In ~250 Myr, all continents will converge to form Earth’s next supercontinent, Pangea Ultima. A natural consequence of the creation and decay of Pangea Ultima will be extremes in $$p_{\mathrm{CO}_2}$$ p CO 2 due to changes in volcanic rifting and outgassing. Here we show that increased $$p_{\mathrm{CO}_2}$$ p CO 2 , solar energy (F⨀; approximately +2.5% W m−2 greater than today) and continentality (larger range in temperatures away from the ocean) lead to increasing warming hostile to mammalian life. We assess their impact on mammalian physiological limits (dry bulb, wet bulb and Humidex heat stress indicators) as well as a planetary habitability index. Given mammals’ continued survival, predicted background $$p_{\mathrm{CO}_2}$$ p CO 2 levels of 410–816 ppm combined with increased F⨀ will probably lead to a climate tipping point and their mass extinction.

It's an Ice Age mystery that's been debated for decades among anthropologists: Exactly when and how did the flow of Homo sapiens in Eurasia happen? Did a cold snap or a warming spell drive early human movement from Africa into Europe and Asia?

A new study appearing in Science Advances compares Pleistocene vegetation communities around Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia, to the oldest archeological traces of Homo sapiens in the region. The researchers use the ""remarkable evidence"" to tell a compelling story from 45,000-50,000 years ago with new detail: how the first humans migrated across Europe and Asia.
The new pollen data suggest warming temperatures supported forests that expanded into Siberia and facilitated early human migration there, at roughly the same time as more and western areas of Eurasia.
""This research addresses long-standing debates regarding the environmental conditions that early Homo sapiens faced during their migration into Europe and Asia around 40,000 to 50,000 years ago,"" said co-author Ted Goebel, professor of anthropology at the University of Kansas. ""It provides critical insights into environmental conditions at Lake Baikal, using pollen records to reveal surprising warmth during this period.""
Indeed, the pollen data suggest that the dispersal of people occurred during some of the highest temperatures in the late Pleistocene, which also would have featured higher humidity. The ancient pollen record shows coniferous forests and grasslands characterized the region, able to support foraging and hunting by humans. Goebel said the environmental data, combined with archeological evidence, tell a new story.
""This contradicts some recent archaeological perspectives in Europe,"" said the KU researcher. ""The key factor here is accurate dating, not just of human fossils and animal bones associated with the archaeology of these people, but also of environmental records, including from pollen. What we have presented is a robust chronology of environmental changes in Lake Baikal during this time period, complemented by a well-dated archaeological record of Homo sapiens' presence in the region.""
Goebel's collaborators were lead author Koji Shichi of the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute in Kochi, Japan; Masami Izuho of Tokyo Metropolitan University, Hachioji, Japan; and Kenji Kashiwaya of Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.

While the pollen analysis was carried out in Japan, Goebel and Izuho tied the pollen data to important evidence in the archeological record of early human migration. Goebel said the emergence of full-fledged Homo sapiens in the archaeological record corresponds to changes in culture and behavior. Early modern humans of this period were making stone tools on long, slender blades, working bone, antler and ivory to craft tools -- including some of the first bone needles with carved eyelets for sewing and early bone and antler spear points.
""Some of us argue that as the anatomical changes were occurring, as evidenced by the fossil record, there was a simultaneous shift in behavior and cognition,"" Goebel said. ""These early humans were becoming more creative, innovative and adaptable. This is when we start to observe significant changes in the archaeological record, such as cave paintings. We also find mobile art, like the early carvings known as Venus figurines. In Central Europe, there's even an ivory sculpture dating back to this early period, depicting a lion-headed man. It's not just replicating nature; it's about creative expression, inventing new things, exploring new places.""
At least one human bone has been found in the region that dates to the era, according to the KU researcher.
""There is one human fossil from Siberia, although not from Lake Baikal but farther west, at a place called Ust'-Ishim,"" Goebel said. ""Morphologically, it is human, but more importantly, it's exceptionally well-preserved. It has been directly radiocarbon-dated and has yielded ancient DNA, confirming it as a representative of modern Homo sapiens, distinct from Neanderthals or Denisovans, or other pre-modern archaic humans.""
Goebel said the earliest human inhabitants of the area likely would have lived in extended nuclear families or small bands, as they seem to have done in other areas of Eurasia. But because so much archeological evidence is degraded, it's difficult to know with certainty.
""At Ust'-Ishim in Siberia, we have evidence of a fully modern human co-existing with the sites we've been discussing,"" he said. ""However, Ust'-Ishim was an isolated discovery, found by geologists eroding from a riverbank. We lack information about its archaeological context, whether it was part of a settlement or simply a solitary bone washed downstream. Consequently, linking that single individual to the archaeological sites in the Baikal region is tenuous -- do they represent the same population? We think so, but definitely need more evidence.""

We reconstruct a detailed vegetation history for the Last Glacial period based on pollen spectra from Lake Baikal. While herb and shrub taxa including Artemisia and Alnus dominated throughout most of this period, coniferous forests rapidly expanded during Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events 14 (55 ka ago) and 12 to 10 (48 to 41 ka ago), with the latter presenting the strongest signal for coniferous forest expansion and Picea trees, indicating remarkably humid conditions. These abrupt forestation events are consistent with obliquity maxima, so that we interpret last glacial vegetation changes in southern Siberia as being driven by obliquity change.
